"Divyansh singh Jadav","4","Great process but pathetic Stock cooler","The cpu is overall great for everything, it‚Äôll give you flaw less performance in mediocre level video editing and hardcore level gaming and streaming. If you are looking to buy this just for gaming this is the perfect buy. But the only thing disappointing is the stock cooler. First of all I would like to request intel to please stop making this clip coolers they are so unreliable and annoying sometimes it fits sometimes it doesn‚Äôt. And also the clips are so fragile that you might break one someday trying to fit it just provide us with a simple screw and bolt cooler with a proper mounting. Also the performance is not nice, many would say stock cooler is more than enough for 12400f but in my case when rendering a video my cpu temps touched 100 degrees so I took out the cooler and reinstalled it to ensure proper installation but still it was going 90 to 95+Degrees. And it was approx the same case while gaming. Idk maybe my cooler clips are just faulty that the cooler is not able to mount properly and is not doing any cooling. So be careful with the stock cooler, or I would suggest to buy an after market cpu cooler or aio especially you live somewhere like India where it gets to 40 degrees easily and you don‚Äôt have an ac in your room, aio is the choice.","Reviewed in India on 3 April 2022","Intel Core I5 12400F 12 Gen Generation Desktop Pc Processor 6 CPU with 18Mb Cache and Up to 4.40 Ghz Clock Speed Ddr5 and Ddr4 Ram Support Lga 1700 Socket Micro ATX","",""

If you are looking to buy this just for gaming this is the perfect buy. But the only thing disappointing is the stock cooler. First of all I would like to request intel to please stop making this clip coolers they are so unreliable and annoying sometimes it fits sometimes it doesn‚Äôt. And also the clips are so fragile that you might break one someday trying to fit it just provide us with a simple screw and bolt cooler with a proper mounting. Also the performance is not nice, many would say stock cooler is more than enough for 12400f but in my case when rendering a video my cpu temps touched 100 degrees so I took out the cooler and reinstalled it to ensure proper installation but still it was going 90 to 95+Degrees. And it was approx the same case while gaming. Idk maybe my cooler clips are just faulty that the cooler is not able to mount properly and is not doing any cooling. So be careful with the stock cooler, or I would suggest to buy an after market cpu cooler or aio especially you live somewhere like India where it gets to 40 degrees easily and you don‚Äôt have an ac in your room, aio is the choice.","Reviewed in India on 3 April 2022","Intel Core I5 12400F 12 Gen Generation Desktop Pc Processor 6 CPU with 18Mb Cache and Up to 4.40 Ghz Clock Speed Ddr5 and Ddr4 Ram Support Lga 1700 Socket Micro ATX","",""

"TechfanUK","5","","I've owned more expensive CPUs - up to AMD Ryzen 9 and Intel 13900K. In most cases these were overkill and ran hot with high wattages! Most of the work I was doing offloaded everything to my GPU so having a beastly CPU was a waste.I've downgraded to this CPU in my main desktop rig. It's great for productivity software (music and design work) as well as gaming. I have it paired with a RTX 4000 series card and haven't noticed a significant drop in frame rates whilst gaming. (maybe 1-5 FPS) In most games I max out the monitor's 144Hz/FPS at 1440p.One different thing about this CPU over other Intel offerings is that it has 6 performance cores (with 12 threads - hyperthreading) and no low powered efficiency cores. (they are only really needed for laptops anyway to save battery power!)The CPU is also very efficient and runs quite cool. Mine is 26c when idle and 26-30 light tasks such as browsing the web. During gaming - the temps are usually in the mid 50s. Benchmarking (such as Cinebench and Geekbench etc) reaches mid 60s. I am using a two-fan DEEPCOOL AS500 PLUS air cooler with three case 120mm fans.All in all - very happy with purchase and highly recommend! :)","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 January 2024","Intel Core I5 12400F 12 Gen Generation Desktop Pc Processor 6 CPU with 18Mb Cache and Up to 4.40 Ghz Clock Speed Ddr5 and Ddr4 Ram Support Lga 1700 Socket Micro ATX","",""

My old 5820k was creating a HUGE bottleneck issue for my GPU, which I installed about a month prior. What a difference I must say. Now that I'm finally out of the stone age, I'm in awe as to how much things have changed in the PC gaming world. This current build smokes everything I throw at it so far. Which admittedly has only been a few games and benchmarks. I paired the processor and GPU with water blocks from an AIO Corsair system for my CPU, and a separate Granzon custom loop for the GPU. All I can say is wow. Fast boot times, 150 plus fps in some games like The Division 2 with medium settings at 1440p. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this processor/Z790 motherboard/GPU combo. Are there better options for better performance or there? Absolutely. But for the money, I believe that the average gamer would be hard pressed to find any significant issues with that platform. I was skeptical at first, as this is the first I5 processor I ever purchased for a PC, but as I stated previously, I am quite satisfied with my decision to take a leap of faith.

I play numerous of strategy games but I do also play Grand Theft Auto (as an escape...) American truck simulator as of late and Roblox. The processing performance has been excellent. I hope that one day I can overclock one of these processors without having to worry about frequencies and voltages. Basically said it's it's 12th generation processor and that's been recent in the past two to three years. It is on the mid-range of the spectrum for Intel i5, but really just seems to automate on its own and it actively will try to lower utilization numbers once it's processed what it has to process.

Tried it on a fairly decent MSI Z790 Tomahawk motherboard.I tried the i5 8400, 10400F, 11400F and now this 13400F, and this is the first one that dissapoints.The turboboost behavior is not what I'm used to. I do not recommend this one. The performance overall is better then the older ones ofcourse, but the powerlimits and frequencies are all over the place, and not how it should be on paper. Max turbo power should be 143Watts and all core turbo 4.1GHz . My sample's All core turbo didn't go above 3.9GHz and the power draw didn't went above 80 watts. and that's lower then previous gens.

But the Raptor was as rare as hens teeth in retail, supposedly kept for the OEM market and for slightly more power and without a boxed cooler. Well what did I get? The Raptor around 5% quicker than Alder, anything quicker in pc gaming is a plus. LolYou can also recognize Stepping B0 (Raptor Lake) in a better catalog by the S-Spec code, which is SRMBG. It differs from Stepping C0 (Alder Lake, S-Spec code SRMBN) in the last letter of the designation ‚Äì ‚ÄúG‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúN‚Äù Check the CPU die as per my picture.

"Alessandro","5","","I am now trying that I write this review, I find that it is as required as its predecessor, the 12400f, with 100mHz more that they are not even perceived, perhaps with the architecture a little improved it seems more reactive to me, but it is a feeling probably,Data in hand we are there. As the 12400f with 4 more ecore that probably in the productive environment give that more pinch of calculation that does not hurt. So 10 cores and 16 threads with a 4GHz in gaming clock is very armored always very armored,It is not unlocked, only the frequencies of the RAM can be adjusted, the processor is and that remains, in this Intel unfortunately it has always been very tirchy, or take the K series or do not change even a comma.A part this philosophical-commercial choice, this processor goes that it is a fairy tale, with a 3070 it turns well a little and for that handful of watt that consumes does not warmer not even much.Future will give these figures, for a gaming PC, so to speak ""entry level"" at that price is a good deal.","Reviewed in Italy on 26 March 2024","Intel Core I5-13400F Processor 20M Cache Up to 4.60 Ghz LGA 1700","",""

"Erdem G√∂ren","5","","I bought this processor due to its price-performance ratio because I wanted to upgrade my system. The packaging is simple, no irrelevant information and has an appealing effect on me.The processor was added with a boxed cooler, i.e. directly with a suitable air cooler.Using the mainboard is very simple and the feel is very appealing.As always, the product name and the clock frequency is shown on the processor. The CPU has no real competition in its price field that have similar services.The price is also very appropriate.Above all, I like the division of the processor cores, which also fulfills the tasks of the PC separately that the maximum performance has also taken out.The processor has no graphics unit due to the -f marking.The frequency of the processor is quite high and also offers a very satisfactory performance.I only get the CPU on half the utilization under very difficult conditions. My only criticism here is the air cooler.The CPU does not get too hot with it, but it is quite loud and because of it I would better advise another air cooler or even a water cooling.

"Dylin","3","","The Intel Core i5-13600K is the latest champion in the mid-range desktop processor arena, promising top-notch gaming performance and efficient multitasking. But does it reign supreme, or face dethronement by rivals? Let's sharpen our critical swords and delve into its strengths and weaknesses:Pros:Performance Powerhouse: 14 cores (6 P-cores + 8 E-cores) and 20 threads deliver exceptional performance for gaming, content creation, and demanding workloads. Compared to its predecessor, the 12600K, it offers a significant performance leap.Gaming Prowess: Tears through even the most graphically demanding games with ease, boasting high frame rates and smooth gameplay at 1080p and beyond.Multitasking Maestro: Handles heavy multitasking like a champ, effortlessly juggling multiple applications, browser tabs, and demanding tasks simultaneously.Overclocking Champion: Unlocked multiplier allows for enthusiast-level overclocking, squeezing even more performance out of the silicon for those seeking ultimate power.DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 Support: Future-proofed with support for the latest DDR5 memory and PCIe 5.0 technology, ensuring compatibility with cutting-edge hardware upgrades.Cons:Power Hungry Prince: This performance comes at a cost, with a higher TDP (125W) and potential for increased power consumption compared to lower-power alternatives.Temperature Tantrums: Can run hot under heavy load, requiring beefy cooling solutions to maintain optimal performance and prevent thermal throttling.Pricey Pedigree: Carries a premium price tag compared to some Ryzen 5 competitors offering similar performance in certain scenarios.Windows 11 Preference: While technically compatible with Windows 10, Intel recommends Windows 11 for optimal performance and feature utilization.Motherboard Matchmaking: Requires a newer LGA 1700 motherboard, adding to the overall upgrade cost.Verdict:The Intel Core i5-13600K is a force to be reckoned with in the mid-range gaming processor category. Its exceptional performance, overclocking potential, and future-proof compatibility make it a tempting choice for serious gamers and creators. However, the higher power consumption, price tag, and potential thermal issues require careful consideration.Overall Rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars (with a slight temperature-related deduction)Should You Buy It?Absolutely! If you're a hardcore gamer or demanding content creator seeking the best value for performance in the mid-range, and aren't afraid of a little thermal taming, the 13600K is a top contender.Consider alternatives: If budget, power consumption, or Windows 10 compatibility are major concerns, explore Ryzen 5 options or consider the slightly less powerful (and cooler) i5-13500.","Reviewed in the United States on 4 January 2024","Intel Core i5-13600K Desktop Processor 14 cores (6 P-cores + 8 E-cores) 24M Cache up to 5.1 GHz' Socket LGA 1700","",""

If you're upgrading to 13th gen Intel, and don't require the additional non-gaming related benefits of 13700k or 13900k, you can't go wrong with the i5-13600k. Even with XMP enabled to 6000Mhz & a Noctua NH-U12A tower cooler on top, this beast never gets truly hot in any game. Granted, I have a very good case for airflow, but regardless it's extremely rare I ever see this CPU hitting the 70's when gaming (this includes 1440p gaming at basically maxed settings), with plenty of utilization headroom on top of that. I paired this beastly CPU with the Sapphire Nitro Plus Radeon 6950XT & have been having an amazing experience all around. If you're deeply considering 13th gen, & your main focus is gaming, then the 13600k will perform up there with the best without all the additional heat the higher end SKU's give off. Genuinely give this CPU a 10/10, never in my life did I ever anticipate an i5 to be this great, but just goes to show it's more about the generation and less about the number after the i.

I stood up a Plex docker container and added my footage and this CPU handles transcoding and streaming my videos no problem and it's great to go back and easily re-live some of those storms.We also have a growing library of TV shows and Movies and it also handles streaming those as well.I imagine this CPU would be awesome for gaming as well, but I don't have any experience with this chip and gaming but there are plenty of reviews that do go over that.Overall I'm happy with my purchase and would easily recommend this chip to anyone building a media server.","Reviewed in the United States on 23 January 2023","Intel Core i5-13600K Desktop Processor 14 cores (6 P-cores + 8 E-cores) 24M Cache up to 5.1 GHz' Socket LGA 1700","",""

"honey the monster","5","","I LOVE THIS CPU. It's marketed as a value chip for the performance conscious gamer - at least in the reviews I've seen but that misses the mark. At 70 fewer watts than the i9-13900K you can actually cool the thing on air and enjoy similar single core performance, and with a respectable multicore performance score as well.My chip actually runs faster than Passmark says it should, but that might be because of my RAM. I got the K chip to get faster DDR5 speeds, not faster clock speeds, since I'm on air cooled, but at 5.1GHz I'm not for want of more cycles.My last CPU was an AMD Ryzen 7 4750G. Respectable for its day, but when I saw the performance of this Intel I decided it was time for me to switch back.My recommendation is that if you're running an air cooled gaming system, strongly consider this chip even if you have the cash for a 13th gen i9.

"Sam","5","","Upgrading to the Intel Core i5-13600KF Desktop Processor from my Ryzen 5800X3D has been a game-changer for my computing experience. This powerhouse of a processor, with its 14 cores (6 P-cores and 8 E-cores) and a substantial 24M cache, has significantly enhanced the performance of my system. The ability of this CPU to turbo up to 5.1 GHz is particularly impressive, contributing to a remarkable improvement in processing speed and overall system responsiveness. Whether I'm running demanding applications, engaging in high-end gaming, or juggling multiple tasks simultaneously, the i5-13600KF handles it all with an ease that is immediately noticeable. The efficiency and speed are especially evident in CPU-intensive tasks, where this processor clearly outshines its predecessor.Beyond just raw performance, what I appreciate about the Intel Core i5-13600KF is its balance between power and efficiency. The division of Performance-cores and Efficiency-cores means that it smartly allocates resources based on the task at hand, ensuring optimal performance without unnecessary power consumption. This aspect is crucial for a balanced system that's powerful yet not overly taxing on energy use. The upgrade process itself was straightforward, and the compatibility with a wide range of motherboards and hardware made the transition smooth. In terms of gaming, the difference is palpable, with smoother frame rates and faster loading times. For creative tasks like video editing and 3D rendering, the performance boost has been equally beneficial, noticeably reducing the time spent on rendering and processing. All in all, the Intel Core i5-13600KF has proven to be an excellent upgrade from the Ryzen 5800X3D, offering a superb blend of performance, efficiency, and versatility. It's a 5-star processor that I'd highly recommend to anyone looking to upgrade their system for an enhanced computing experience.","Reviewed in Canada on 13 January 2024","Intel Core i5-13600KF Desktop Processor 14 cores (6 P-cores + 8 E-cores) 24M Cache up to 5.1 GHz' LGA 1700","",""

"YALE70","5","","I won't go into much technical detail here since there's people a lot smarter than myself who can get into the nitty gritty. Generally speaking though - this CPU absolutely smokes, especially for the price. Don't let the 'i5' name fool you. The i5-13600K (and KF) is a top-class processor that for most users, will offer more than enough performance for intensive tasks while having probably the most reasonable power consumption and cooling requirements of the top-three 13th generation Intel processors.I came from an i7-5960X - still a solid processor in this day and age but unfortunately my motherboard wasn't exactly kind to me attempting to take it above 3.8 GHz. Despite it bottlenecking against my 2080 Ti, it still ran cool under a 360mm CLC, topping out at no more than 51 degrees C gaming (GPU load) and 60 degrees under full CPU loads. But since the current market for new components is pretty good, I opted to go all in on a 13th gen build rather than find a better X99 motherboard.Odds are, you're probably going to be cross shopping the i5-13600K with the i7-13700K and the i9-13900K. Unless your workflow necessitates the additional core count or you're chasing records, the performance difference between those CPUs and the 13600K did not seem worth the hundreds of dollars of additional cost and the massive increase in peak power consumption. Power also equals heat, and that was another motivating factor for going with the 13600K, having been accustomed to a relatively cool and quiet build for some time. That said; with the additional cores and much higher boost frequency, I was expecting higher peak power draw and temps despite a lower TDP on paper.And they were definitely higher, under the same 360mm CLC. After running benchmarks with Cinebench and 3DMark, I was hitting peak temps in the mid-to-high 70s under full CPU loads. Gaming loads however were definitely more manageable though, sitting in the 40s and seldom breaking 50 degrees, which was actually a small but appreciable improvement over the 5960X. I'd advise at minimum a high quality air cooler or a 240mm CLC for this processor.The out of the box performance is something else though. I managed to hit 23345 on a multi-core Cinebench test and a 16459 combined score on 3DMark Time Spy. Again, this is stock clocks paired with an overclocked 2080 Ti and 32GB of DDR5 at 5600 MHz. At 3440 x 1440 and 144Hz, games run like butter. I could dabble in overclocking it since I have the headroom but honestly, I don't see the point. It's fantastic as is.All in all, I feel like the 13600K is kind of the no-brainer option for most people looking to put together a high-end system on a budget. You're getting most of the performance of it's more expensive stablemates for a much lower price and less obnoxiously high power and cooling requirements. The KF is also a little cheaper if you don't need integrated graphics. Just buy it. You'll love it.","Reviewed in the United States on 22 February 2023","Intel Core i5-13600KF Desktop Processor 14 cores (6 P-cores + 8 E-cores) 24M Cache up to 5.1 GHz' LGA 1700","",""

I went from 30- 40 watt average to average 80 and in some instances spiked above 100. The good thing is emulators are much less GPU bound so the wattage balances out, sort of.Heat- I‚Äôm running an AIO lian li 360 Galahad, with the 12400f I was nearly always running at room temp (my house gets lots of shade and stays cool/cold) so I was used to 22c range. With the 13600k you  will see a 10 degree increase even at idle. Emulators will get into the 60s while triple A games 40s and 50s. With the 12400f my fan curve rarely ever triggered high fan speeds. With the 13th gen you will definitely hear those fans work at load.Side notes I tried the 13600k on two mobos (z790 and 690) you can use it on older 690 compatible mobos, you just need to flash bios to latest. It was super easy on the gigabyte z790 and 690 mobo.Overall. The performance jump is noticeable in some games. But far more noticeable is the increase in heat and wattage usage. If you have a 12th gen and are on the fence you really don‚Äôt need to upgrade, however depending on what you are doing with it could be the main factor. I wanted my RPCS3 to run at 60fps in 4k constantly and the 13600k did the trick.  (playing MGS4 guns of the patriots in 4k and stable is unreal!)","Reviewed in the United States on 11 April 2024","Intel Core i5-13600KF Desktop Processor 14 cores (6 P-cores + 8 E-cores) 24M Cache up to 5.1 GHz' LGA 1700","",""

"Carey Holzman","5","","This is a great product at a great price that runs cool with the included cooler. However, every motherboard manufacturer is now OVER VOLTING the CPUs causing them to run hotter and be less efficient so they can pass benchmarks with slightly higher scores at the cost of cooking your CPU. Look up the PL1 (long term power) and PL2 (short term power) ratings for your CPU and compare it to the massive over-volting your motherboard is doing to it without your knowledge or consent.In this case, the PL1 on a 14500 is 65w and the PL2 is 154w. My AsRock board was over-volting this to 219w+!!! No wonder it was cooking the CPU. This is not even an over-clockable CPU!There is a setting in the AsRock BIOS EZ screen to ENABLE INTEL POWER LIMITS, but it does not work! You need to go to advanced settings and find the long and short power limits and put them back MANUALLY to Intel's specifications.Now your chip will not over-heat, will cost less money to run, will last longer, be more reliable and you do NOT need to waste your money on more expensive coolers or thermal paste, nor waste your time installing and wiring all that up!!!!!!!","Reviewed in the United States on 19 March 2024","Intel Core i5-14500 Desktop Processor 14 cores (6 P-cores + 8 E-cores) up to 5.0 GHz","",""

"Amazon lover","5","","So far so good.  This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.  My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen.","Reviewed in the United States on 3 November 2023","Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i5-14600KF New Gaming Desktop Processor 14 cores (6 P-cores + 8 E-cores) - Unlocked","",""

I originally purchased the i9 13900k, did no overclocking but had soooo much trouble with the system that I stupidly replaced the mainboard and video card.  I didn't refund as I assumed that I had done the damage.

Yet again assuming that I must have done something wrong I ordered this replacement chip, to find issues suddenly occuring again.  This is about when the news dropped on mainboard suppliers and intel passing the buck on an inherently co dependant series of faults that have personally cost thousands upon thousands of dollars.I'm an IT professional, have been in the industry for more than 20 years, and have never encountered a situation so costly for the end consumer.I really hate to say it, I hold stocks in intel, I've loved them as a brand and considered them to be a number one choice, I can no longer say this.I honestly think there should be a class action lawsuit over this chip and it's predecessorI had to purchase 2  rtx 4090 and 2 asus mainboards before I could even lock down this issue.I hate to say it but if I'd gone with a competitor I would have saved multiple thousands of dollars.","Reviewed in Canada on 3 May 2024","Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i5-14600KF New Gaming Desktop Processor 14 cores (6 P-cores + 8 E-cores) - Unlocked","",""

"Deven","5","","This professional CPU isn't designed for the average user. However, if you're a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube ""videos"" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I've acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailers‚ÄîBest Buy, Newegg, and others included.For those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fans‚ÄîAvoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics.When selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn't your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank.The 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouse‚Äîachieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It's a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns...Did I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40¬∞C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50¬∞C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I'd advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methods‚Äîincreased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true.As of this date‚Äî4-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that's a discussion for another time.The X3D Elephant in the room: Don't worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias...We'll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults.""Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there's no cause for concern. Let's briefly touch on the ""benefits"" like reduced thermals and supposed platform longevity (as if motherboard chipset upgrades and advancements in power delivery methods don't occur... humor me, over the planned 6 years). I, too, long for Z390 features on my Z790 board (/end sarcasm), not to mention the potential for longer boot times when tinkering with DDR5 or PBO, or even under normal conditions, and texture stutter/tearing... oops, and all those other delightful topics Lisa tends to highlight without addressing the influence of influencers with communications degrees rather than computer science degrees.  Just having fun, do what you love!I don't blame Amazon, Intel, AMD, or Nvidia more than the other. Manufacturing and shipping issues happen. The chip I received from Amazon didn't meet my expectations, but my other purchases have been exceptional. By chance alone, the other four 14900Ks I've received from various distributors have been stellar!Note:Settings in pictures are daily driven....No stability concerns all AIDIA 64 Stress tested for multiple hours and hundreds of gaming/workload hours.

"Austin","5","","A lot of people are upset with the 14900k because of the minimal performance leap thar came between it and the 13900k. I say who cares. If you have a 13900k, don't upgrade, but if you have an older PC or 12th Gen, this is a worthy upgrade. I absolutely love mine. It's a monster of a CPU.I honestly don't recommend air cooling it. It can get pretty hot and there are only a small handful of air coolers that can handle this 14900k without setting power limits (which most people don't know how to do, let alone even know what that means)If you're not doing a custom water loop to cool your 14900k, I recommend you do what I've done to cool mine, you dont neeeed to, but it helps. I have an AIO (All-In-One Cooler) and I setup a push-pull configuration on my radiator. That means I have 3 fans on the bottom blowing in through the radiator, and 3 more fans blowing up and out of the case. Both are blowing upward. It creates more airflow. One side is pushing the air, the other side is helping pull that air through. Then I got a thermalright contact frame. Any LGA 1700 contact frame should work but the thermalright version is cheap. It might say 12th/13th Gen but it will also work on 14th Gen. So get an AIO, setup a push-pull fan configuration and get a contact frame. It's helping my Temps significantly. I typically stay in the high 50's or low 60's during 4K gaming. This CPU draws a ton of power so you might see it bump up to 80‚Å∞ occasionally, for a very brief moment.

"J","4","","I built 3 systems using 14900 series. They all had serious stability problems when in use.  After researching for weeks and reinstalling OS with no better result.  I finally disabled overclocking ""AI overclocking"", which was running as high as 1.6v.  I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE.  this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully.  It basically throttles the chip.I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out.  Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine.  I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive.  It does run HOT even with water cooling.  IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5.  Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips.Here's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use.  Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing.  HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300.  So a small advantage in Adobe CS is why I went with the 14900K vs KF.System was using ""AI overclocking"" pushing it to 6.2 roughly single core.  Disabled in BIOS now.Specs: Asus z290a Wifi II, Corsair 96GB DDR5 5600, Samsung 990 Pro, CPU Water cooled, 3080tiSo the ""K"" is basically useless for me at this point and don't see myself doing it manually as it's just not worth it to me.

"JZ the reviewer","5","","I'm not going to go over the same performance reviews others have done, yes its very fast for only $550 its the king of the poor mans build PC. my last PC its replacing was a $1000 10980xe and looking at the numbers the 14900k in average is 70-77% faster than the 10980xe. the only disadvantage between the 2 was the 10980xe had 48 PCIe lanes and ran 32c to 56c hot.i can't say the same about the 14900k heat, its spreader is almost half of the 10980xe. you can't just simply add a stock cooler or a ""MC'watercooler"" and expect the problem will solve itself. this is the first CPU in my 26 yrs of building PC's you have to plan out your cooler set up.ever since a 2012 water leak from these Mc'watercoolers (all in one 2 fan radiator kits sold by name brands) Ive never trusted them cost me $1500 in damages. The only water coolers that don't leak for me were the ones i built but water cooling is expensive and you have to inspect them at least every 3 months for debris in the tank or leaks. with air i only have to clean the pc 2x a year.yes you can control temps with an air cooler, and get the same temps as a 3 fan radiator water cooler. I'll post the results without adding a watt limit in the mobo post screen.here is the parts i bought to air cool running the new cinabench 2024 for 30 mins i can get max performance on a defualt non OC not hitting above 99C on the P cores1.

Thermalright Intel 12th/13th Generation LGA1700 Anti-Bending Buckle ( a must add a little thermal grease on the cpu side flaps this buckle is 100% aluminum will al help dissipate heat.then i went to my mother board software options (mobo is an MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX) select ""CPU cooler tuning"" select ""tower air cooling"" which will limit the wattage draw to under 300w also note if you are not using a Water Cooling Reservoir  you should also use this option, water cooling a 14900k and OC really does require a reservoir, and a 4x 120 fan size radiator if you're simply using a pre-built 2x fan radiator its not enough to handle the 14900k and the CPU is known for drawing 370w plus!!so using air cooled i got a 2371 score with no watt limiter option an temps were 78-100c on the p cores, and with the 300 watt limit the score was  2328 with temps 70-99c never hit 100c case the limiter would kick in. (note this is from CPU testing that punishes the CPU realistically i don't see this CPU going over 88c even on the most demanding game in 3 years.i personally do not recommend OC this CPU its already been pushed to its limits by INTEL at best for another 100 watts when all you're getting is 3-4 more FPS and that's not worth it. and all these people bragging a 6.2-6.5ghz OC, there just flexing for clout, then they take the CPU back to default. i already have my P cores spiking to 6.002 at 288-300 watts, and under 99c temps; adding 0.198mhz will meaning nothing for apps and gaming.personal note the MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX Gaming Motherboard is absolutely amazing at squeezing out all the performance of the 14900k worth the $700 price never crashed during testing that 26 power phases is godly  compared to my last gen EVGA x299 dark had 12 phase...RIP EGA :(","Reviewed in the United States on 11 February 2024","Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i5-14600KF New Gaming Desktop Processor 14 cores (6 P-cores + 8 E-cores) - Unlocked","",""

"Eric E.","5","","So I finally upgraded my home workstation, and went to this new i9-14900K. It is incredibly fast. I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.! Also, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly. Applications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build. The one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims. With this new cpu, I can only run 2 GPU's and they run at 8x, cause they share the 16x, and that does leave me 4 full pcie4.0 lanes for the system drive. It is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it. One thing EVERYBODY should be aware of, is these new intel chips have P cores and E cores. Something my old cpu did NOT have. E-cores can severely impact certain software performance. When I booted up the new machine and tried my Ableton DAW  for the first time, I was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost, and the software was literally almost unusable.! The E-cores were slowing the software down so bad, I could barely change settings in the preferences.! It was that bad. I had to install process lasso ( fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it ) and disable the use of E-cores for Ableton and then it worked very fast and is great.!","Reviewed in the United States on 19 March 2024","Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i5-14600KF New Gaming Desktop Processor 14 cores (6 P-cores + 8 E-cores) - Unlocked","",""

After switching back to auto clock, I still managed the same temps, but getting 5.1-5.2Ghz on Pcore and 4.3 on Ecore.

"elviscera","3","","Once they came down in price, I did get a i9-14900K as an ""upgrade"" from a i9-13900KF to  i9-14900K .  It's OK but I can't rave over it.  It is more of an sideways change rather than an upgrade.The i9-14900K is fast but not more so that a i9-13900K.  For me, the Cinebench R23 scores are about the same for 13th versus 14th gen.  Though the i9-14900K appears to run DDR5 more stably and at higher frequencies than the i9-13900K.  Also, the i9-14900K is enabled for XTU AI enable tuning in XTU but it's not that helpful.  I even wonder if it is worth getting a K at all, these CPU's are plenty fast for gaming without overclocking.I did NOT notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures.  Maybe a slight improvement but I did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so I am doubtful that the running temps are better.  Also, I suggest that you NOT let these chips get anywhere near TjMax (100C).  I had one i9-13900KF literally fail due to allowing it to get to TjMax frequently when stress testing.  A second one became slightly flaky.I thought the built in ARC display support of the K version might be helpful since I intended to devote the graphics card to the gaming monitor and use the built-in ARC on a side display.  But as it turns out, it wasn't worth it for me.  If you are gaming with this level of processor, you really need a comparable graphics card but most of them will drive four displays.  IMO, you are better off getting a KF and spending the money so saved on better graphics card.The original asking price was insane, I bought it on a whim on a late night.  On the morning morning after, I had buyers remorse, tried to cancel but could not, so instead, I refused the package.  It took literally 6 months to get a refund.

The 13900K was fast, significantly faster then the 12900K, and this CPU even though on paper it doesnt look like they did much, and in benchmarks it looks close, it still feels like 15-20% faster the 13900K when your using it.

"Jachin Boaz","5","","I'm using the stock Intel cooler that came with my 12700 and the highest I hit in games is about 79c, most of the time is stays in the low 70s. Idle temps stay in the 30s. That's with the cpu wattage unlocked and raising the pl1 and pl2 settings a bit in the bios and a single intake and single exhaust fan in a mid size case. I learned a long time ago that ambient room temp and fan curves are very important. You want to exhaust as much hot air as you can out of the case as fast as possible. You can mount a skyscraper to your CPU and have 12 case fans, if your room temp is high and you don't set proper fan curves, you'll still run hot. I don't care about cinebench or other benchmarks, most games people play and apps people use on a daily basis will never stress the CPU anywhere near what a benchmark will. If you do a lot of heavy video editing and conversion work and raise your wattage limits way up then yes go for a higher end cooling solution .Edit: I've since installed an Intel RH1 cooler (the one that comes with the i9) on this chip and it dropped my temps by an average of about 8c. I know I can buy a third party cooler but I don't want a huge cpu cooler in my case and I don't want to play with brackets that may not fit 100% correctly. You can find new RH1 coolers on ebay for pretty cheap.","Reviewed in the United States on 1 June 2022","Intel Core i7 (12th Gen) i7-12700 Dodeca-core (12 Core) 2.10 GHz Processor - Retail Pack","",""

"Simon Chester","5","","Greetings fellow tech enthusiasts! I've upgraded from a creaky old second generation Sandy Bridge i7 to the shiny new Alder Lake i7-12700KF... And what a difference it's made.  Here's what we've got:12 cores and 20 threads make this CPU a powerhouse for multitasking and performance. Absolutely night and day compared with the 4 cores of Sandy Bridge.  Overclocking? It's a breeze, like wielding a magic wand for speed.No integrated graphics on this model, but lets be honest who uses integrated graphics these days?In a nutshell, this CPU has breathed new life in to video editing (videos are rendering in minutes, not hours now, phew) & gaming for me.

I doubt that the CPU was used by someone else before and returned to the seller, and the seller is sold it to me. (I've built many pc's before, I konw what I'm talking about.)

"Anish Roy","5","A superb piece of a processor","No doubt, 12th gen Intel processors are a marvel of computing technology. Although there is a continuing tug of war between Intel and AMD in this regard. I personally chose Intel Core i7 (12700K) with inbuilt UHD graphics for my newly built desktop PC. For those, who don't want to use a separate and usually exorbitantly priced graphics cards, this processor is a very good alternative. It can handle most of the processing intensive rendering of Blender easily with its unlocked overclocking (obviously you have to use the supporting motherboard, i.e. presently available Z690 chipset motherboards). It can also smoothly handle almost all the tasks of Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop with no hiccups. Not to mention the support of 4K video with HDR if you are looking for some decent and the latest entertainment in your PC. I would suggest this 12th Gen i7 to those who want to use their PC for content creation purpose in the best possible way and also at the same time save some money (compared to 12th Gen i9, which would ideally be the best anyway, but costlier too). The price is still at a high level. Hopefully this comes down soon with the launch of Intel's 13th Gen processors!","Reviewed in India on 28 June 2022","Intel Core i7-12700K Desktop Processor 12 (8P+4E) Cores up to 5.0 GHz Unlocked LGA 1700 600 Series Chipset 125W","",""

"Jacob","5","","I upgraded to this CPU after some HEAVY research, asking Reddit (Both Intel and AMD subreddits), weighing in money VS performance gained. I have used AMD since I was a teen and started building computers. The conclusion is this: It is an amazing CPU, runs faster and cooler than my Ryzen 7 1700. The price AND performance VS AMD (Also including a board) was better than if I had went with a Ryzen 7 5800X.Some background information: I wanted to upgrade after receiving an Amazon gift card (I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon though). I upgraded from a Ryzen 7 1700, with an ASUS x370-f board. I really wanted to upgrade, and was sad also that Windows 11 did not support my CPU! I will give it to Microsoft for this, as it made A LOT of people upgrade their entire computers, all for basically the same OS as of now with newer looks, and not much done under the hood (EXCEPT for 12th gen Intel, so good news there too). Sadly, my old board STILL doesn't support the Ryzen 7 5000 series, and only the 3000 series (They are working on a BIOS apparently for the 5000 series, because of people who were in my shoes). I first almost ordered the Ryzen 7 3800XT, for $400! After a couple hours of research, asking, and thinking about it... I cancelled that order (Thankfully) and thought ""Well, if I am going to spend this much on upgrading my CPU, I might as well go all in/spend a little more for something better, as this may be my last big upgrade in this regard for awhile."" I was then going to get the Ryzen 7 5800X with an Asus board. There lied a problem of price, I could not find a board AND get that CPU still within my budget (At-least not a board that wasn't worse than the one I had in ways). I mentioned I had posted on the AMD subreddit, and even they suggested I go Intel (Intel is just killing it as of now, hands down, although I am sure AMD will retaliate). I ended up getting the MSI Z690-A DDR4 (I wish I had the money for DDR5 RAM, I would have went with the DDR5 version as it was basically the same price). I had A LOT of second thoughts on this board though, as it just didn't seem ""Premium"" as the one I had (I am going to do a whole review on it after this. I'll save my Pros & Cons for there.) This CPU also auto-clocks itself up or down depending on the load (Saw it clock down to 1GHz, although not for long, for example if not much processing power is warranted, which makes sense and I wish everything did). So if idling, it will clock down and save power/heat/and therefore longevity is increased. I absolutely love this CPU coming from AMD. Anyways...If you have a Corsair H100I RGB Platinum or similar cooler already: The included 1200 screws work just fine with the 1700 socket and this CPU, even though you are supposed to get the 1700 kit/screws for this CPU (Which I did, but they are taking FOREVER to ship, so I googled, and someone said using the 1200 screws will work just fine). I get better temps. than my Ryzen 7 1700. I can even overclock EVEN MORE but have no need, and no point.TL:DRUpgraded from: Ryzen 7 1700, Asus Rog Strix x370-f gaming.Upgraded to: i7-12700K, MSI Z690-A DDR4.Parts kept: 4x8GB 32GB DDR4 CL16 3000MHz RAM (With XMP, D.O.C.P), RTX 2070. The RAM works great with this CPU as well, although it TECHNICALLY (Latency wise, runs at 2T on Intel instead of 1T on AMD) runs slower than when on AMD (AMD's infinity fabric) but obviously whatever Intel is doing makes up for that, and therefore my RAM either runs faster/the same)Pros: It is an amazing CPU for price VS performance. The i5-12600K is good as well (I almost just went with it), and you would be fine going with it for gaming (As even it still has more cores technically than the Ryzen 7 5800X, it also beats the 5800X even though THIS CPU is supposed to be its comparison rival brother.) This CPU has cool temps on my Corsair H100I RGB Platinum cooler, and the P&E core structure are REALLY cool and fun to watch when doing tasks/gaming. It shipped fast!Cons: Literally none with the CPU itself. Just with shipping - It shipped really fast! Was here in 2-3 days after purchasing on here. The biggest complaint I have is Amazon's shipping (SO BE AWARE OF THIS) I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon, and have always used New-egg. They just left the CPU in my mail-box, and if it weren't for me looking at my camera's, and looking out for this part, it would have sat in the mail-box all day. My mail-box sadly is not very weather proof as well, and if it had been raining... It wouldn't have been good. Although it did come in a big box around it. The CPU also was jarred loose and flopping around in the box (Not held into the front window).I hope this review helps people!","Reviewed in the United States on 25 February 2022","Intel Core i7-12700K Desktop Processor 12 (8P+4E) Cores up to 5.0 GHz Unlocked LGA 1700 600 Series Chipset 125W","",""

The only real downside of the 13600k is that it generally requires a 13th gen compatible motherboard, otherwise you'll need to FLASH THE BIOS on a 12th gen compatible motherboard to update the motherboard for it to be able to read 13th gen CPU (I highly do not recommend doing this). I've tried it a few and it's such a big hassle (many potential issues...)that I recommend first time PC builders or part buyers to just save yourself a headache and buy a 13th gen CPU, along with a 13th gen compatible motherboard (don't buy 12th gen mobo) which obviously doesn't require flashing bios for the 13600k to be usable.","Reviewed in Canada on 5 August 2023","Intel Core i7-12700K Desktop Processor 12 (8P+4E) Cores up to 5.0 GHz Unlocked LGA 1700 600 Series Chipset 125W","",""

As of this writing, I hope you've done your research the I7-12700k's price point and its competition. For this price point, it may be the top dog.Some things to consider before purchasing:1) Make sure you are purchasing a LGA 1700 motherboard. I went with the DDR4 motherboard because DDR5 is still at its infancy. The DDR5 ram may not be the best option for your buck right now. You'll be fine with DDR4.2) This CPU does consume a lot more power compared to its predecessor. Double check if your PSU will be enough. There are online resources that will help you calculate your PSU. It's always good to have a little overhead.3) Make sure your heatsink has retrofit screws that's compatible with this motherboard. You can purchase them separately. If you have a heatsink that's very old (<2016), it's more than likely it may not be compatible.Good luck!","Reviewed in the United States on 15 February 2022","Intel Core i7-12700K Desktop Processor 12 (8P+4E) Cores up to 5.0 GHz Unlocked LGA 1700 600 Series Chipset 125W","",""

Example for photo editing applications is more performing the K series, while for renderings is more performing the not K. Forum, the choice in my case was simple since I didn't want to go to an Z790 and since I wanted to go to an air padding (I chose the Deepcool Assassins 4).Then I was lucky enough to take a ""used as new"" version, where apart from the damaged box there were no other signs of usury, including the disperse supplied.Without appropriate protection (horrible), so if the deformed thermal paste would have been used (it was intact).

Finally, it is that, for the same hardware, I had the opportunity to test with Cinebench R23 both i7 processors-13700 and i7-13700K (at the stock frequency). The results emerged after numerous repeated tests followed: 13700k: about 27,500 points with Multicore Enhancement (MCE) off. 3700K: about 28,000 points with multicore enhancement (MCE) unlocked. 13700:About 24,000 points with Multicore Enhancement (MCE) off.13700: about 28,500 points with Multicore Enhancement (MCE) unlocked <- more than 13700k! For some strange reason (which I still ignore), the activation from BIOS of the Multicore Enhancement (betweenthe other blocked at 90 ¬∞, but it could be completely unlocking, gaining another 500-1,000 points) does not generate almost any improvement on the K.

When compared to competitors like the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X and Ryzen 9 5950X, the i7-13700KF shows a remarkable 23% and 25% single-core performance bump, and an even more impressive 67% and 15% lead in multi-core performance against these AMD chips‚Äã‚Äã.However, buyers should be aware that the Core i7-13700KF does not come with integrated graphics.

"Steve","5","","Very happy with this processor. It has a very good amount of L3/L2 Cache which I was particularly interested in, and has very good clock speeds as well. Upgrading from an i5-9600k which I was using a much more modest air cooler, this unit is a bit more tricky for cooling.I am using an ARCTIC Liquid Freezer II 240 water cooler, and this bad boy still hits 100c running Cinebench/Prime95. I ended up setting the TDP wattage to 253w in the Bios per suggestions, and this helped slow down the thermal climb a bit (without affecting overall performance). Of course this is a ""worst case"" scenario, it hasn't hit anywhere near 100c in real world use.Just make sure you get a highly capable cooler for this chip.","Reviewed in the United States on 16 February 2023","Intel Core i7-13700KF Gaming Desktop Processor 16 cores (8 P-cores + 8 E-cores) - Unlocked","",""

"Dave Hammers Tech Garage","5","","üëâ I start from the conclusions: it is a truly remarkable CPU, I own a pair of 12900k on other builds but this 13700k in some respects is more performing.I am not a player and I use PCs for work.My experience is therefore aimed at professionals who work with videos, photos, 3D reconstructions, 3D editing, photogrammetries etc. etc., unlike the 12900k (on Mobo Asus Proart Z690-Creator WiFi with Deepcool LS720 and Asus Rog Strix Z690-A Gaming WiFi D4 with Itek Evoli 240 Argb both with the Thermalright frame) that mounted without touching the bios do not shoot Watt absurdi (but I think it depends more on the BIOS than on the CPU), this 12700k (on Mobo Asus Proart B760-Creator WiFiWith Noctua NH-D15 Chromax.Black and Frame of Thermalright), he warms a little more. Instead, compared to 13900k, always reviewed here on Amazon, I didn't want to intervene from the BIOS also because after the first minutes in stress tests, forExample with Cinebench 23, during which the BIOS always pushes the processor to the limit (over 360 watts), everything calms down.The boost lasts a few moments and immediately after consumption stands on the 253 watts, consequently even the temperatures drop, so much so that the average ones of the cores hardly exceed 90 degrees (in the 10 min test) ‚öñÔ∏è The processor offers really excellent performance,All programs run smoothly like oil, thanks also to the 64 GB of memory.The Adobe Suite, from Photoshop to After Effects, from Illustrator to Premiere Pro, Blender, 4D Cinema and Metashape Pro (i.e. the programs that I use most) are supported by so much power and have no hesitation.Also with several applications open on 13700K, it works largely .üöÄ On Cinebench R23 the score is 28550 on the single render, maximum temperatures of the core 4, 5 and 7 (the most hot) of 100 ¬∞ while in the 10 min test of 10 min the scoreIt was 27497 with maximum temperatures of 100 ¬∞ respectively for Core 3, 5 and 7c.A difference in only 3.69 % between the single render and the Throttling test.Not bad! In the Throttling test of 10 min, the maximum values ‚Äã‚Äãof the individual cores vary between 93 ¬∞ and 100 ¬∞, while the average ones between 83 ¬∞ -85 ¬∞, therefore more than acceptable.The maximum consumption is 351 watts while the average ones 260 watts. In idle the temperatures vary between 21 ¬∞ and 47 ¬∞. You can check from the photos üò¨.

"Federico M.","5","","Packaging the Intel tradition teaches, from some series to this part, all the processors are inserted inside a box made of cardboard.Outside the main information that it is good to know about the processor are shown, beyond and some important information such as the reference numbers.To have a detailed product of the product, it is sufficient to go to the manufacturer's website to have all the details. Even the interior of the package remained practically the same tradition / philosophy, where the processor in itself is contained within a container ofplastic, which in turn, is blocked by the cardboard of the package, so as to avoid a possible fall during the shipment of the article, moreover, since the external structure made of cardboard but the plastic part placed only in the center, it seals any bumps duringtransportation is also provided by the classic manual with adhesive attached to be applied to your homes with this new series, i.e. 13 esimo.Description of the article by a series 9, more precisely i7-9700k series i7-13700k can only be aI definitely pass forward.In fact, my previous processor presented 8 cores and 8 threads instead of this which has 16 cores and 24 threads.In addition, it can be defined as a processor divided as there are 8 core performances (P-core) and 8 efficient cores (e-core).The former can reach a maximum speed of 5.4 GHz, while the efficient core 4.2 GHz.The basic frequency with regard to the efficient cores is 2.5 GHz.The basic power of the processor is 125W but can reach 253W in turbo. Obviously the management whether to use efficient or power cores is given by the operating system and by the workload that is required.If the bios is equipped with it (like mine in this case) it is in fact possible to deactivate e-cores or always bring them to their maximum speed.However, I strongly advise against doing this soft-AVERCLLUK as with these new generation processors is completely ""useless"" given the monstrous performance that they manage to offer, so as to avoid going to compromise their reliability.In fact, I personally contested that on very heavy games and areas, automatic management is absolutely perfect, allowing really low work temperatures and a truly remarkable surrender.) with FPS blocked at 75, the latter never fall under this threshold but on the contrary, they tend to increase slightly.With the previous configuration there were multiple drops in frames. The same I had the opportunity to ascertain it on a competitive game, as can be fortnite, blocking the FPS to 144 and the latter remain stable on this threshold without ever falling and without precisely, thatThe minimum lag that would be deleterious on a game where the speed is fundamental. The work that has been done on these new CPUs is simply remarkable, I was really surprised by the speed in doing the operations since it is really very fast to do everything, but especially surprises on the performance that occur on the gaming side.I add that my tests are performed on the last building 22h2 of Windows 11.Conclusioniin conclusion, I consider myself absolutely satisfied with this processor.I also want to emphasize that all my tests were carried out with a ""dated"" RAM by only 2667 MHz.For this processor, in fact, a frequency of at least 3200 MHz is recommended as regards the DDR4 and obviously supports the DDR5 RAM widely that reach even higher speeds compared to the previous series.Tuttavia, despite this ""problem"", since it is not a problem, thePerformance that I had the opportunity to ascertain through benchmark are respectable. Obviously being a new processor just released, you will have to wait a little before Windows in particular, it is updated to the best to fully exploit the power offered by this processor.At the same time, it is really difficult to find one at a fair price.In my case, considering that my previous processor broke, I had to find a quick replacement immediately.Paid about 500 euros (a little less), I can say that the price is absolutely in line with the quality ratio of the product offered and obviously taken into consideration that it is a series presented only at the end of October 2022 and certainly a product that will bevalid for the next few years.Without the slightest doubt!","Reviewed in Italy on 1 January 2023","Intel Core I7-13700K Processor 30M Cache Up to 5.40 Ghz LGA 1700","",""

"Sircam","5","","The Intel I7-13700K processor of the Raptor Lake series and with LGA1700 socket indicates in the name the 13th generation (about 2022) and which has unlocked Fabrica for the overclocking of its frequencies, however always risky activity for anyone who is not really experienced.It has 16 cores and a frequency ranging from 3.2GHz to 5.4GHz with turboboost and an energy demand of only 125W and integrates an excellent video card for basic tasks (navigation, office, video streaming, light graphic processing).It natively supports the RAM DDR5 modules by solving the (few) problems present with the past generation.I come from the same model, obviously older and with less core.Personally I believe that this CPU is very solid, stable and performing for long gaming sessions and I prefer it compared to the Intel I9-13xxx higher band due to better multicore management duringthe games.In fact, I believe that the i9 processor was designed for duties other than gaming and I wanted a product that as also performances and use/cost ratio was as optimized as possible.Sia with a ssd sata that with a M2 Windows starts and is operational in hand20 seconds (having disabled the function that never turns off the PC, so the start is real starting from a complete extinguishing state). Any recent video game manages the cores without problems and the processor itself ""turns off"" those not necessary for the'performed activity.Even with those games that require high -end hardware as a suggested requirement for an optimal experience, this CPU falls abundantly in the list - and it will do so for a long time. For the title of comparison my old Intel I7-3700 has been able to hold upand start without problems any video game that came out from 2013 to today without ever slowing down or warming further measure and I have no doubt that with this modern and updated version it is the same. A small thing to pay attention to: the CPU warms up.It is not its flaw but its operating temperature especially after hours of gaming.Get ready for its premature departure if cooled inadequately and/or inserted in small houses.My model was not a garage (therefore sold without fan) and I turned to a well-known brand famous in the industry for the purchase of the dedicated fan.IAlways a good quality/price ratio, but I wanted to exaggerate to be quiet with the specifications of the games to come.

On CBR24 you can easily hit 100*C and above without any modifications, this is not great but Intel claims that the thermal throttle happens at 105*C so anything below that number is ""fine"". I think most people are not comfortable with temps that high and considering I'm using a 360mm AIO I don't imagine 100*C is acceptable in any scenario. In any case, undervolting is really worth it. I've set my undervolt in XTU to be at 0.085V and my temps are maxing at about 85*C which is much better.

I bought an ASRock z790 PG lightning /d4 board to go with it so I could use my existing DDR4 ram.  The difference was night and day!  I have an ID-Cooling 280mm AIO (cheapest I could find on Amazon) with a contact frame and kyronaut thermal grizzly extreme paste and does not thermal throttle on Cinebench R23 unless I run 3 or 4 passes back to back.  I am thrilled with how well this CPU runs.I was able to bump my DDR4 up to 4200mhz in gear 1 (timings cl20/26/26/26/48) after a bios update from ASRock and this thing is rock solid and crazy fast!  I get an average of 30500 in cinebench r23 and it will overclock as far as you want - I have taken it to 5.7 and it runs fine, it just thermal throttles quickly at that speed.  I'm pretty sure I could overclock this beast to the moon if I threw a lot more money into a custom cooling loop, but it is plenty fast as is.

I have Crucial RAM 64GB Kit (2x32GB) DDR5 4800MT/s CL40 Desktop Memory CT2K32G48C40U5 modules (4 of them), a Corsair RM1000x (2021) Fully Modular ATX Power Supply in a Phanteks Enthoo Pro Full Tower Chassis without Window Cases PH-ES614PC_BK in service for about one year as I write this review. For the most part, assembly was very easy. I do video editing, audio editing, streaming, wordprocessing, browsing and email with my setup. I use all of my SATA ports and even have a plug-in eSATA card for more ports. So most of my drive bays are filled. The cpu, dram and everything I have connected to my power supply and motherboard has been rock solid stable, and the case holds in all together. It just works exactly the way I want and have no anomalies. The power supply, motherboard and all components run cool in the case with an i7-13700K CPU, 128 GB of Crucial DDR5-4800 that is clocked at 5200 automatically set by the motherboard itself. My video card is a the very modest ASUS GeForce GT 1030 2GB GDDR5 HDMI DVI Graphics Card (GT1030-2G-CSM) because I transitioned my ancient setup from MBR to GPT and needed to be able to boot the old system in the new motherboard before updating the Windows 10 Pro config to GPT UEFI and still be able to boot legacy devices. Everything just worked like a Swiss Chronograph. I strongly recommend this cpu, dram, the power supply, the case, the ASUS ProArt Z790-Creator WiFi 6E LGA 1700, the Asus video card, and am also recommending the Crucial MX500 SATA drives I use.

"A Reader","4","","After too many years of gaming on an old i7-6700K I finally decided to pull the upgrade trigger this year.  I purchased the most up to date CPU and other components with the hope this one will last me as long as the last one did. Overall I think this is a great CPU, however it is a bit frustrating when you try to cool these things. Intel just keeps pushing these CPUs harder and harder to try and beat the performance metrics of AMD, but in the process they are making CPUs that are anywhere from near impossible to difficult at best to keep cool. After a lot of tweaking in the BIOS I finally got this one to stay below the 90 degree Celsius threshold, but that doesn't account for how hot it still makes my room when I'm gaming. The extra heat was kind of nice during the winter months, but as summer is approaching I'm wondering how this is going to pan out...Anyway, the CPU is completely as advertised and worked flawlessly out of the box. I didn't run into any errors or issues with this CPU. Overall I 100% recommend it because Intel has never let me down. I've been building my own systems for more than 20 years now too, so that's a pretty long track record of CPUs that just worked and never died. Because of that I can easily recommend this CPU and I would definitely order it again.","Reviewed in the United States on 19 June 2023","Intel Core i7-13700K Desktop Processor 16 cores (8 P-cores + 8 E-cores) 30M Cache up to 5.4 GHz Socket LGA 1700","",""

I'm a sysadmin by trade, so remoting in and fixing servers has never been an issue with that processor..but for gaming..Titles like Cyberpunk, Days Gone, to even WoW..there were areas that my 3080 was being bottlenecked by the 9900k.I coupled this CPU with a MSI EDGE z790 DDR4 (I have fantastic Samsung B-Die CL14 3600 DDR4 from the previous build). So far, in Cyberpunk I'm seeing 25-30 more FPS on 1440p Ultra settings w/ Raytraycing on High. WoW is getting 50+ more FPS, and I'm getting over 100 FPS in Valdrakken, where I was getting 45-50 FPS with the 9900k with the same settings as cyberpunk (1440p ultra (10 graphics settings).I'm using the Corsair iCUE H100i Elite LCD 240mm AIO, with Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut Extreme thermal paste to cool this bad boy, and even at prolonged sessions in Cyberpunk, my temps are not getting above 65c.

The reasonable pricing for Z690 or Z790 boards makes the i7-13700K a good combo compared to AMD‚Äôs expensive Ryzen 7000 CPUs and motherboard costs. For people who are still on older generations, the vast E cores and P cores offered by Intel‚Äôs 13th gen make it worth it to accomplish CPU-intensive tasks like Handbrake or Adobe Premiere.

"Amazon lover","5","","So far so good.  This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.  My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen.","Reviewed in the United States on 3 November 2023","Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i7-14700KF New Gaming Desktop Processor 20 cores (8 P-cores + 12 E-cores) - Unlocked","",""

Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I'd advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methods‚Äîincreased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true.As of this date‚Äî4-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that's a discussion for another time.The X3D Elephant in the room: Don't worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias...We'll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults.""Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there's no cause for concern. Let's briefly touch on the ""benefits"" like reduced thermals and supposed platform longevity (as if motherboard chipset upgrades and advancements in power delivery methods don't occur... humor me, over the planned 6 years). I, too, long for Z390 features on my Z790 board (/end sarcasm), not to mention the potential for longer boot times when tinkering with DDR5 or PBO, or even under normal conditions, and texture stutter/tearing... oops, and all those other delightful topics Lisa tends to highlight without addressing the influence of influencers with communications degrees rather than computer science degrees.  Just having fun, do what you love!I don't blame Amazon, Intel, AMD, or Nvidia more than the other. Manufacturing and shipping issues happen. The chip I received from Amazon didn't meet my expectations, but my other purchases have been exceptional. By chance alone, the other four 14900Ks I've received from various distributors have been stellar!Note:Settings in pictures are daily driven....No stability concerns all AIDIA 64 Stress tested for multiple hours and hundreds of gaming/workload hours.

"Austin","5","","A lot of people are upset with the 14900k because of the minimal performance leap thar came between it and the 13900k. I say who cares. If you have a 13900k, don't upgrade, but if you have an older PC or 12th Gen, this is a worthy upgrade. I absolutely love mine. It's a monster of a CPU.I honestly don't recommend air cooling it. It can get pretty hot and there are only a small handful of air coolers that can handle this 14900k without setting power limits (which most people don't know how to do, let alone even know what that means)If you're not doing a custom water loop to cool your 14900k, I recommend you do what I've done to cool mine, you dont neeeed to, but it helps. I have an AIO (All-In-One Cooler) and I setup a push-pull configuration on my radiator. That means I have 3 fans on the bottom blowing in through the radiator, and 3 more fans blowing up and out of the case. Both are blowing upward. It creates more airflow. One side is pushing the air, the other side is helping pull that air through. Then I got a thermalright contact frame. Any LGA 1700 contact frame should work but the thermalright version is cheap. It might say 12th/13th Gen but it will also work on 14th Gen. So get an AIO, setup a push-pull fan configuration and get a contact frame. It's helping my Temps significantly. I typically stay in the high 50's or low 60's during 4K gaming. This CPU draws a ton of power so you might see it bump up to 80‚Å∞ occasionally, for a very brief moment.

"J","4","","I built 3 systems using 14900 series. They all had serious stability problems when in use.  After researching for weeks and reinstalling OS with no better result.  I finally disabled overclocking ""AI overclocking"", which was running as high as 1.6v.  I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE.  this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully.  It basically throttles the chip.I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out.  Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine.  I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive.  It does run HOT even with water cooling.  IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5.  Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips.Here's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use.  Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing.  HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300.  So a small advantage in Adobe CS is why I went with the 14900K vs KF.System was using ""AI overclocking"" pushing it to 6.2 roughly single core.  Disabled in BIOS now.Specs: Asus z290a Wifi II, Corsair 96GB DDR5 5600, Samsung 990 Pro, CPU Water cooled, 3080tiSo the ""K"" is basically useless for me at this point and don't see myself doing it manually as it's just not worth it to me.  That said, when stable, it's a very capable chip.","Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2024","Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i7-14700KF New Gaming Desktop Processor 20 cores (8 P-cores + 12 E-cores) - Unlocked","",""

"JZ the reviewer","5","","I'm not going to go over the same performance reviews others have done, yes its very fast for only $550 its the king of the poor mans build PC. my last PC its replacing was a $1000 10980xe and looking at the numbers the 14900k in average is 70-77% faster than the 10980xe. the only disadvantage between the 2 was the 10980xe had 48 PCIe lanes and ran 32c to 56c hot.i can't say the same about the 14900k heat, its spreader is almost half of the 10980xe. you can't just simply add a stock cooler or a ""MC'watercooler"" and expect the problem will solve itself. this is the first CPU in my 26 yrs of building PC's you have to plan out your cooler set up.ever since a 2012 water leak from these Mc'watercoolers (all in one 2 fan radiator kits sold by name brands) Ive never trusted them cost me $1500 in damages. The only water coolers that don't leak for me were the ones i built but water cooling is expensive and you have to inspect them at least every 3 months for debris in the tank or leaks. with air i only have to clean the pc 2x a year.yes you can control temps with an air cooler, and get the same temps as a 3 fan radiator water cooler. I'll post the results without adding a watt limit in the mobo post screen.here is the parts i bought to air cool running the new cinabench 2024 for 30 mins i can get max performance on a defualt non OC not hitting above 99C on the P cores1. Noctua NH-D15 chromax.Black | Dual-Tower CPU Cooler | 140mm | Black2. Noctua NF-A15 HS-PWM chromax.Black.swap (this adds a 3rd fan for the air cooler you'll need it)3. FDXGYH 4 Pcs CPU Heatsink Fan Buckle PC Mainboard CPU Radiator Fan 12CM Wire Buckle Upper Hook Type Fixing Clip  (these buckles are compatible with noctus 140mm fans)4. Easycargo 40mm Heatsink Kit 40mmx40mmx20mm (this you place on the flat base of the noctua cooler will help dissipate heat)5. Easycargo 100pcs Heatsink Assortment Kit Small Cooler Aluminum Heat (these you throw on the back of your mobo on and around the mount brackets you'll me amazed how adding heat sinks on the back of the mobo will reduce temps)6. Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut (this is the best thermal grease cooler by 1-2c cooler than artic silver mx 6)7. Thermalright Intel 12th/13th Generation LGA1700 Anti-Bending Buckle ( a must add a little thermal grease on the cpu side flaps this buckle is 100% aluminum will al help dissipate heat.then i went to my mother board software options (mobo is an MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX) select ""CPU cooler tuning"" select ""tower air cooling"" which will limit the wattage draw to under 300w also note if you are not using a Water Cooling Reservoir  you should also use this option, water cooling a 14900k and OC really does require a reservoir, and a 4x 120 fan size radiator if you're simply using a pre-built 2x fan radiator its not enough to handle the 14900k and the CPU is known for drawing 370w plus!!so using air cooled i got a 2371 score with no watt limiter option an temps were 78-100c on the p cores, and with the 300 watt limit the score was  2328 with temps 70-99c never hit 100c case the limiter would kick in. (note this is from CPU testing that punishes the CPU realistically i don't see this CPU going over 88c even on the most demanding game in 3 years.i personally do not recommend OC this CPU its already been pushed to its limits by INTEL at best for another 100 watts when all you're getting is 3-4 more FPS and that's not worth it. and all these people bragging a 6.2-6.5ghz OC, there just flexing for clout, then they take the CPU back to default. i already have my P cores spiking to 6.002 at 288-300 watts, and under 99c temps; adding 0.198mhz will meaning nothing for apps and gaming.personal note the MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX Gaming Motherboard is absolutely amazing at squeezing out all the performance of the 14900k worth the $700 price never crashed during testing that 26 power phases is godly  compared to my last gen EVGA x299 dark had 12 phase...RIP EGA :(","Reviewed in the United States on 11 February 2024","Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i7-14700KF New Gaming Desktop Processor 20 cores (8 P-cores + 12 E-cores) - Unlocked","",""

I want to delid it but I don't see the need and here is whyEven if I can get it 20 degrees cooler it will not matter It will still need 3.5 to 4.2 volts to stay stable at advertised speeds.I am running it @ 5.4 GHZ all P cores and this thing is unbelievably reliable . And maybe 10 seconds extra to render vs 5.7 to 6.0 GHZI get the point that ppl want to have the Bragging rights to say that it runs that fast but it will gwt damaged guaranteed 400 watts is a lot for that little unit. I think that 5.4 5.3 5.2 is more than enough specially when you have a total of 32 threads and gaming is practically single threaded . And most games are GPU bound. I only use it in the gaming department for Flight simulator and have not seen it above 68 degrees.I had a 4770 k and still running strong at 4.5 GHZ in a very small case.Intel is a beast and this I 9 is very good .

"Eric E.","5","","So I finally upgraded my home workstation, and went to this new i9-14900K. It is incredibly fast. I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.! Also, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly. Applications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build. The one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims. With this new cpu, I can only run 2 GPU's and they run at 8x, cause they share the 16x, and that does leave me 4 full pcie4.0 lanes for the system drive. It is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it. One thing EVERYBODY should be aware of, is these new intel chips have P cores and E cores. Something my old cpu did NOT have. E-cores can severely impact certain software performance. When I booted up the new machine and tried my Ableton DAW  for the first time, I was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost, and the software was literally almost unusable.! The E-cores were slowing the software down so bad, I could barely change settings in the preferences.! It was that bad. I had to install process lasso ( fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it ) and disable the use of E-cores for Ableton and then it worked very fast and is great.!","Reviewed in the United States on 19 March 2024","Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i7-14700KF New Gaming Desktop Processor 20 cores (8 P-cores + 12 E-cores) - Unlocked","",""

"elviscera","3","","Once they came down in price, I did get a i9-14900K as an ""upgrade"" from a i9-13900KF to  i9-14900K .  It's OK but I can't rave over it.  It is more of an sideways change rather than an upgrade.The i9-14900K is fast but not more so that a i9-13900K.  For me, the Cinebench R23 scores are about the same for 13th versus 14th gen.  Though the i9-14900K appears to run DDR5 more stably and at higher frequencies than the i9-13900K.  Also, the i9-14900K is enabled for XTU AI enable tuning in XTU but it's not that helpful.  I even wonder if it is worth getting a K at all, these CPU's are plenty fast for gaming without overclocking.I did NOT notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures.  Maybe a slight improvement but I did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so I am doubtful that the running temps are better.  Also, I suggest that you NOT let these chips get anywhere near TjMax (100C).  I had one i9-13900KF literally fail due to allowing it to get to TjMax frequently when stress testing.  A second one became slightly flaky.I thought the built in ARC display support of the K version might be helpful since I intended to devote the graphics card to the gaming monitor and use the built-in ARC on a side display.  But as it turns out, it wasn't worth it for me.  If you are gaming with this level of processor, you really need a comparable graphics card but most of them will drive four displays.  IMO, you are better off getting a KF and spending the money so saved on better graphics card.The original asking price was insane, I bought it on a whim on a late night.  On the morning morning after, I had buyers remorse, tried to cancel but could not, so instead, I refused the package.  It took literally 6 months to get a refund.

"Another Customer","5","","Sorta came from a 13900k but I gave that to a relative after their x299/i9-7940x system began to have issues. He bought a z790 board and was amazed how far ahead the 13900k is in comparison an overclocked Skylake-X processor. He fixed the issue with the x299 system, but he decided to stay with Raptor Lake. All of which is okay by me because that old 13900k had no overclocking headroom, and I could only undervolt it by 5mv before it became unstable. I was going to buy another 13900k or maybe the ks version, but I decided to wait for the 14900k.The 14900k I got on the other hand has some overclocking headroom. I already set all P-cores to 5.8GHz, while keeping the double-core Turbo Boost at 6.0GHz. I also set the cache to 5.2Ghz and it's completely stable. I was not able to raise the multiplier at all with my 13900k. Just happy my 14900k isn't a lottery loser.While the clock of both the 13900ks and 14900k are the same, the 13900ks has a cherry picked memory controller. If you're looking to do a ton of RAM overclocking then the 13900ks may be the way to go.... but that's not to say if you'd get a 14900k with a good memory controller. Both my 13900k and 14900k work with DDR5-7200 RAM with XMP set, and no adjustments to the memory controller voltages.If you're buying the 14900k off the get-go and building a new system around it, then I recommend pairing it with a motherboard that has the BIOS Flashback feature.","Reviewed in the United States on 22 October 2023","Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i7-14700KF New Gaming Desktop Processor 20 cores (8 P-cores + 12 E-cores) - Unlocked","",""

Multitasking, gaming, and content creation have all seen a significant improvement. Multithreaded applications and gaming experiences run smoother.  It's a productivity powerhouse. The clock speeds are no slouch either, making it excellent for single-threaded tasks and gaming. The major downside of this CPU is the heat it generates. Even with a high-end cooling solution, it tends to run hot, and that's something you must take into consideration when setting up your cooling solution. Be ready for this CPU to draw a significant amount of power at full load. It can put quite a load on your power supply and might necessitate an upgrade if you're not already prepared. The Intel i9-14900k is an incredible processor, and the upgrade from an i7-8700k is substantial. Its exceptional performance in various tasks justifies its price tag.

"Mergatroid","5","","I was using a 10700K. I decided it was time..well, actually I got the itch.I decided to go with the 14700K for a few reasons. One is that it's the only 14th gen part from Intel that got a significant upgrade (four more e-cores and 8 more threads, plus a small clock boost).I also don't like that the 3DFX part from AMD had caused some minor issues for people, and I definitely don't like the RAM issues I see all the time on AMD systems. If it wasn't for the RAM issues, I may have gone AMD this time. Out of all the Intel systems I have assembled for customers over the years, I have not once come across a RAM issue that wasn't caused by bad RAM.This CPU is working perfectly, and gaming excellently. Gaming benchmarks show it to be a very good CPU, and I am not having any issues with it.If you are interested in any other Intel parts, I suggest going with 13th gen as you will basically get the same part for less money.

I play all kinds of games, FPS, MMO's, survival, etc.  (Paired with a Gigabyte Gaming 4090 OC, Tforce 64 gigs 6000 M/T DDR5, samsung 990 pro NVME 2 tb x2, no OCing done by me.)I replaced a 5950x, which was having issues for some reason, just felt like it was getting slower and slower, thermal paste and heat were fine on it, never got over 60c with the beefier AIO I had on it.  Just took longer and longer to render things.  I guess I wore it out!I just think you'll want a good AIO, and/or a solid water cooling solution for this to really get the best out of it.  I'm not sure a air cooled option will do you any good, but hey I've been wrong many times, so there might be something that can handle the job.All in all, not bad, but it's not going to give you much performance boost over last gen, matter of fact I found out later 13700k beats it in a lot of tests, blargh!  Either way, its fast, and it runs everything great, so I'm happy till the next go around.","Reviewed in the United States on 3 January 2024","Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i7-14700K New Gaming Desktop Processor 20 cores (8 P-cores + 12 E-cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked","",""

"Chris H","5","","I decided the difference between the i7 and the i9 didn't justify the price difference, considering I was already getting about 1/3 more performance than my 12th generation i9. I wanted plenty of motherboard resources so I also bought the MSI MEG Z790 ACE, 32 GB of Kingston Fury 6400MT/s DDR5 and a 2TB Samsung 990 NVMe drive.Cooling had been a slight issue with the 12th generation i9, even with a 360mm AIO cooler, so I went custom loop. Along the way I found a GPU water cooler on sale and decided to install a lot of cooling. The Thermaltake 900 tower can take two 560mm radiators, but I wanted some disks, so I went for a 560x140 and a 280x140, both 45mm thick and backed by 6 fans. Four more fans feed air into the case and there's till plenty of clear space for more air to be dragged in.So what's the result? The processor runs at 85C worst case, and only two cores at that temperature. The fast DDR5 does make a significant difference. I initially ran it at 6GT/s then turned it up to 6.2 and finally 6.4. The last change is a 3.5% change in DDR5 speed and that gave me a 2.4% increase in system speed. I kept my old RTX3070 which used to run over 80C and now runs at 62C worst case. So despite more performance the system runs a lot cooler.I mostly run X-Plane 12, which runs the GPU and CPU very hard, continuously. After several hours the cooling water reached 36C and the worst core temperature was 85C. The processor just works. No stability issues with the standard settings on the MSI Z690 motherboard. There are three standard memory tuning options for 6.0, 6.2, and 6.4 GT/s and all work. This will do for me for a few years.","Reviewed in the United States on 31 May 2024","Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i7-14700K New Gaming Desktop Processor 20 cores (8 P-cores + 12 E-cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked","",""
"V91-Bleach","4","","I upgraded from an 8700k to this 14700k nearly 8 years later. Performance-wise, the difference is fairly negligible to me, and that is reflected in the 'real' specs. Going from 6 cores to 20 cores isnt really a 3x+ increase when most of those cores are 'efficiency cores'. User benchmark puts 14700k as only being 47% faster than the 8700k, despite being 8 years and 6 generations apart.The main improvement from my point of view is the reduced idle/casual power use. My UPS tells me that for my 8700k/1070ti system I drew ~0.43 Kw, and my new 14700k/4070ti super draws ~0.31 Kw watching YT, browsing the web (includes fans, monitors, etc).Mostly just wanted more balance for the new graphics card, since that's what does most of the heavy lifting these days anyway.

Unfortunately this did not happen until the 30 day return policy elapsed.  At first I thought it was the motherboard or RAM.  But testing of different RAM ruled that out.  Bios updates to the motherboard did not help the issue.  Putting in a known good CPU allowed the final test of the motherboard and original system RAM and that all passed which indicates a issue with the CPU.  Now I'm waiting for Intel RMA process to have them test the CPU again and hopefully replace it.

"Spiral","5","","Picked this cpu up in August 2023. I upgraded from an i7 4770K to this beast. The i7 4770k was still capable, but honestly I wanted RCPS3 to run better because their getting closer to 75% of the library being playable. Also, I could tell my 8gb of g-skill sniper ram was holding me back and i could not for the life of me find 16gb of ram available that would run with trusted compatibility with my current board. The i9 12900kf hardly touches 20% usage for any new game and older games are even less usage while the video card sits at 99-100% usage, this is the sweet spot for no bottle necking and high performance.The video card is an RTX 2060 Super @ 1440P on Dell's 32"" monitor S3220DGF. With zero brightness and contrast at a hundred, the colors pop. I'd say comparable to OLED with those settings or at least IPS. The CPU is paired with the Z690 Strix motherboard and 32gb of Corsair vengeance ram. 32gb is the sweet spot. I watched a Linus Tech Tip video that said 8gb is good enough but when I run MSI afterburner along with Riva Tuner-statistics , the ram usage is usually between 10 and 12gb's used and sometimes as high as 14gb, with no known programs of mine running in the background. Perhaps we definitely passed the 8gb minimum by now. Itunes, Video Proc Converter, RPCS3, and Virtual DJ are some of my most demanding apps and this cpu just handles them like it's lite work I'm throwing at it. Well, there's the value.

Even the 'slow' cores clock in upwards of 4GHz, which the TR tapped out at best with 4.2 and that was only for a couple cores-worth.This one on air, does back off that max clock not soon afterwards; but I also have this in a 4u rack mounted case, with 4 chassis fans; vs the previous build which was on a 360 radiator/AIO, and had 13 system fans; but I was going for a rather ridiculous build with that vs this build I'm going for subtle/sleeper.That this system runs as fast as it does, with as little fan noise, on air...is something rather amazing.","Reviewed in the United States on 22 May 2022","Intel Core i9 (12th Gen) i9-12900KS Hexadeca-core (16 Core) 2.50 GHz Processor","",""

"Chris H","5","","This isn't the processor for everyone, but it is very fast. The individual cores aren't significantly different from those in the 13th generation i7. But if you have a need for a lot of parallel processing then this may be the processor for you. I do software development, which it doesn't help 99% of the time, gaming, which it helps a little, and occasionally transcoding large amounts of video and music. During transcoding it helps a huge amount. I have over 300GB of FLAC audio files that I ripped from my CD collection, I never buy mp3s. I wanted to have that on my phone, but I didn't want to carry it at full rate because I can't tell the difference in the car, so I transcoded it. I had done that once before and it took more than a day on a five year old Ryzen 7. This machine took around 30 minutes. 30-40 times faster. At work the optics team, which uses ray tracing software to design optical telescopes and laser focusing lenses, uses i9s in preference to Xeons. The Xeons might be faster under some circumstances, but the machines are hugely expensive, so the i9s are much better for price performance. Would I buy it again? I'd probably buy the 13th generation, but if I had any sense I'd just get the 13th gen i7.","Reviewed in the United States on 11 May 2023","Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor16 (8P+8E) Cores up to 5.2 GHz Unlocked LGA1700 600 Series Chipset 125W","",""

"2sofakinggreat","5","","So far this thing is great! I upgraded from the 9900K and this has been a noticeable difference. I'm still in the process of updating drivers and reinstalling some software. I haven't done any overclocking so the Cinebench score and temps are straight stock settings.After seeing all the info on how hot this thing can get I added the Thermalright contact frame. It was a breeze to install. I watched the Gamer's Nexus video about this frame and followed their directions.For the motherboard I went with a MSI Z690 MPG Edge Wifi DDR4 so I could reuse my current RAM. I had to order a LGA 1700 bracket for the NZXT Kraken X73 AIO. I ordered both the frame and the LGA 1700 mount from Amazon and both arrived fast and were exactly what I needed.So far my temps are staying in the general range of my 9900K. I'm planning to do a little gaming this week with it so I'll have a chance to see how it does under my daily use. I also do a bit of Premiere and After Effects so I'm looking forward to seeing how it works there as well.Overall, this is probably way more processor than I NEED. I was still able to do what I needed to do with the 9900K. I built the 9900K in 2020 during the height of the astronomically high PC price wave. I ended up getting this processor for about $100 less than I paid for the 9900K two years ago. So the price-to-performance upgrade for me was a no brainer.If you want a fast processor at a reasonably decent price, this is a great one to get.

"Kira","5","","Purchased this CPU to finally upgrade my tired 8086k that I have had for close to 4 years now, and considering I also own a 3090 I was lucky enough to get last year, it was time. Paired with said gpu and a MSI Tomahawk Z690 with a Noctua NH-D15 Chromax Black cooler, this cpu runs complete marathons around my old 8086k. Certain games that would fully saturate my 8086k while also getting notifications from something like Discord would introduce very bad stutter, however those are completely eliminated with the 12900k. Temps are high when Im doing full resolution photo renders from my DJI Air 2S or Sony a6400 or straight up benchmarking, but that is expected and I'm not one to sweat about 80-90c temps, but if you are I would recommend the 12700k/5900x as they both run cooler and draw less wattage. However in gaming with multiple different Firefox tabs and discord/telegram open, it never even touches 70c, so your experience may vary depending on what type of work load you are doing. Make sure that if you do have a high powered gpu that you also have a high output power supply with a high efficiency rating as well, as my system can suck north of 600-750w full tilt (my power supply being a 1200w platinum EVGA that doesnt break a sweat under full load).","Reviewed in the United States on 21 February 2022","Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor16 (8P+8E) Cores up to 5.2 GHz Unlocked LGA1700 600 Series Chipset 125W","",""

It renders 3D projects at such a speed I hardly have time to do something else before it is complete which is a great change of pace.

It's been at least 5 years since I bought ol' reliable. She's been through rough seas.

As soon as I opened the shipping box I could tell it had been opened before. The edge was uneven and the label crease was loose. I put my X-acto Knife down (which is what you need or something similar to open these as the label is there for a reason) and with just the gentlest of pressure the label peeled away from the center where someone oh so nicely had finely cut the label horizontal to make it easy to fold one side back over the other and with just a quick once over it looked almost normal.If I hadn't opened a few of them already with Intel's fancy new packaging I probably would not have noticed but the way the packaging normally is, it is VERY precise, tight, even lines and you will not be easily or gently opening it up with a simple light finger pry.My biggest fear was there wasn't going to be a CPU in there at all but luckily the right CPU was in there that matched the container batch but if something is sold as new I don't do open boxes.Make sure to check your packages before opening. The seal should be nice and tight and straight. The edges of the back flap should be firm and secure against the other flap and the bottom line/edges should be even and exacting.Give a gentle pull on each corner of the box where the label keeps it sealed to make sure it hasn't been altered or tampered with. It should be VERY firm and unable to just pull open easily. Look at the condition of the box itself around that area and even the gold disk inside.Fresh, brand new i9 12900k's are very pristine and boxed with precision.Still, they are fantastic processors overall and a worthy upgrade from 10th and 11th gen.","Reviewed in the United States on 16 December 2021","Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor16 (8P+8E) Cores up to 5.2 GHz Unlocked LGA1700 600 Series Chipset 125W","",""

"CMDR_Sanford","5","","Previously I had the AMD 7950x and it was pretty fast, don‚Äôt get me wrong. However, this 13900ks is a lot snappier even browsing around in windows 11. Programs launch faster and games are buttery smooth @ 4k ultra details, when paired with an Nvidia 4090. I also love the fact that the ks is a ‚Äúbinned‚Äù CPU, which overclocks more easily and typically handles faster DDR5 memory in the range of 7800-8400Mhz depending on how good the memory controller is in your 13900ks sample. Regardless, you will probably be able to hit 7800-8000 at the least. This purchase is actually my 2nd 13900ks and I ended up getting a better binned version this time. With an overal(Asus) SP of 113, P Cores 123, e cores 93, and memory controller was 83. Im currently running a G.Skill 32GB(2x16GB) 7800mhz DDR5 kit with XMP turned on in the BIOS. I have been able to bump it up to a stable 8000mhz by bumping up the Memory Controller voltage to 1.4v and the VDD/VDDQ voltage to 1.5v using the same timings that were on my 7800 XMP kit CL36. With the CPU and a Corsair h170i 420mm AIO with 6 fans in a push pull configuration, I was able to get a stable CPU overclock of 60/60/58/58/58/58/58/58 on the (8) P cores, but I‚Äôm pretty sure I can bump the 1-3 core workloads higher. It‚Äôs when using a workload that requires all 8 P cores that I run into some stability issues with my current cooling trying to push it past 5.8Ghz using all 8 p cores. I leave my E cores all synced at 4.3Ghz stock to help give me more P core Overclock headroom. Another overclock method that works really well, is easy and stable, is to turn on the Asus AiOverclock. Given that I have used both an MSI and Asus Z790 motherboard, I highly recommend the Asus ROG brand line for a Z790 compatible motherboard for this 13900ks. They update their BIOS version frequently and there quality is typically very good on there products that are produced in higher numbers. The absolute ideal motherboard for Overclocking and using the fastest DDR5 ram would be the Asus ROG Maximus Z790 APEX(2-DIMM) motherboard. If you just can‚Äôt get your hands on one maybe go with the (4-DIMM) Asus ROG Maximus Z790 Hero motherboard. You should be able to reach up to 7600mhz DDR5 on it. Whatever you do don‚Äôt settle on a motherboard, because it‚Äôs the center of the system and can be upgraded later. I started with an MSI Meg Z790 Ace and wish I had started with an Asus. The MSI ran a lot hotter with the same clock speeds and only supported up to 7200mhz DDR5 using 2x16GB sticks. The motherboard attached in the review photo is the Asus ROG Maximus Z790 APEX, a thermal Grizzly 12/13th gen contact frame to make the cpu more level for the heatsink cooler that goes on top and of course the 13900ks that‚Äôs a little dirty from previously applied thermal paste I just wiped off. Sorry for the long winded review, but this has been my favorite CPU that I‚Äôve owned.  It‚Äôs super fast and you can tinker with it for an easy overclock for fun.","Reviewed in the United States on 17 April 2023","Intel Core i9-13900KS Desktop Processor 24 cores (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) 36MB Cache up to 6.0 GHz","",""

"Amazon Customer","5","","Works just fine, really fast, lots of cores.  With all the cores running, they will run up to 100 C and throttle back on clock speed with pretty much any standard CPU cooler.  The consensus seems to be that this is limited by the thermal connection inside the CPU case between the actual chip and the upper surface which contacts your cooling block.  In other words, the cores can overheat even if your cooling system can maintain the upper surface of the CPU at room temperature.  You don't want the cores running hot at 99 C for any length of time, and so you really need to tune the CPU clock speed and the voltages with a motherboard that permits overclock tuning.  With a good standard CPU cooler, I found it's possible to run continuously with a 4.7 GHz clock on all 24 cores and keep the core temperatures below 85 C.","Reviewed in the United States on 24 April 2023","Intel Core i9-13900KS Desktop Processor 24 cores (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) 36MB Cache up to 6.0 GHz","",""

While my AIO does allow it to run at 5700MHz at 100C, the CPU is using over 330 Watts at that speed & delivering an impressive Cinebench score of 41697.  Basically it's too much CPU for any cooler on the market.  Even manually clocking the CPU at 4500MHz cap sees temps at 92C with fans on 100% speed.To get a decent daily use speed that doesn't drive the fans at freight train noise levels, I have to manually down-clock the CPU to 3500MHz which still gives great gaming performance, but keeps the fans down to about 60% fan speed.While the CPU is great for video editing, I don't think that it's worth the premium price over the 3GHz 13900K processor.

"Patrick","5","","Best investment I ever made when it comes to a gaming/streaming pc. I‚Äôm a pretty hardcore gamer and this cpu is the most amazing thing I‚Äôve ever had when it comes to a high end build. I paired it with a rtx 4080 and needless to say this cpu doesn‚Äôt disappoint. Now, this review isn‚Äôt about pricing because we all know this cpu is expensive and honestly if you‚Äôre only gaming then maybe a 13600k would suffice. However, if you are streaming, photo editing, video editing etc‚Ä¶. Then this is the right cpu for you. I‚Äôm able to snap together YouTube videos in seconds NOT minutes or anywhere near it. I‚Äôm able to stream and game at the same time with less than a 10 fps loss while gaming and streaming on the highest quality settings. My wife loves it for photo editing bc everything is just perfect. Only downside is that it does run hot but you can get a good 240-360mm aio that will tame this cpu with ease. All the issues I use to have on the 10th gen platform are completely irradiated now that I own this cpu. I did go with the ddr5 and honestly for me it runs better than ddr4. Tech reviewers say otherwise but from personal experience ddr5 is the future NOW. Performance issues I use to have with ddr4 and weaker cpus are just gone now. I can do so much and this cpu doesn‚Äôt break a sweat. For instance, ddr4 for whatever reason sometimes wouldn‚Äôt work with xmp although it was advertised. I like to tinker so it wasn‚Äôt an issue BUT sometimes it‚Äôs just nice to do a single click and let it dial itself in and that‚Äôs what ddr5 has done for me. I‚Äôve used several different sticks with this cpu and from all of them I went with Corsair vengeance. Honestly, this is the most bada$$ cpu I‚Äôve ever owned or seen in a personal system of mine. If you have the money I couldn‚Äôt recommend it enough. Everybody has different needs and in my case I needed this cpu. It hasn‚Äôt disappointed. As for amd, if you want the bugs and issues go ahead and grab one of those cpus and tell me how that goes. This cpu can do everything and more.

"Nick B","5","","Cinebench R23 scores: 40,345 MT / 2,284 STUpgrading from the Ryzen 5950X, this processor has some significant uplift, particularly in the single-core speed. Minimal overclocking headroom as Intel has already milked 90% of the performance on stock settings. However, with some tweaking, you're likely to get up to 6.2 Ghz boost behavior for single-core loads, and bump up the all-core boost to 5.7 Ghz (up from 5.5 Ghz stock). With some further tweaking of the voltage-frequency curve, you could probably tweak this even further. I'm not a big fan of all-core overclocks on these type of processors, as you will lose the boosting single-core speed. In my opinion, this processor shines for gaming because of its single-core boosting performance.Memory controller has been significantly improved over Alder Lake. I was easily able to get my DDR5 6400 XMP profile running without any tweaking. I'm pretty sure this can be easily pushed further, but it seems like around 6400 Mhz memory is the roughly the sweet spot in terms of price vs performance.Very power hungry, but despite the bad reputation from reviewers, the power consumption can be easily tamed. If you run power limits unlocked, you will likely be thermal limited due to thermal throttling at 100c. However, you don't need unlocked power limits - you're talking about a very small 5-10% performance uplift but using >100W more power to achieve this. I would suggest running it at stock power limits, or unlocked power limits but seriously consider undervolting.On a final note, I wouldn't consider getting the rumored 6.0 Ghz version of the 13900K in the future. The current 13900K can easily be pushed to >6 Ghz boost speeds and will save you money.","Reviewed in the United States on 22 November 2022","IntelCore i9-13900KF Desktop Processor 24 cores (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) 36M Cache up to 5.8 GHz' Socket LGA 1700","",""
"s","5","","i upgraded from 5900xt. I got the msi board z690 -a for 159, and this the 13900kf. I ‚Äòve been wanting a cpu with an IGPU for years, but couldn‚Äôt justify the price increase on the gpu version. I actually use a dgpu but it really is convenient, and they can be used to accelerate some work. Again, before you judge i'm using this for work, productivity. NOT gaming. I would spend 200 for a gaming cpu.my use case is productivity. i‚Äôm a developer, and this is the sole reason i upgraded. I was fighting windows freezing and slowing down during a lot of my workflows. I use wsl intellj, docker, react apps java etc, often at the same time. It‚Äôs pretty noticeable the improvement. It really helped.  Like that i could use ddr4 for now since the boards are about 150 it was acceptable.Heat: The cpu gets a bad reputation due to heat and wattage. I put this in the bucket frankly that amd got as well. I mean it‚Äôs fine they are using as much power as needed to maximize perf. I limited the cpu to 250w, and it runs on a d15 cooler than my 5900, Full load can get up to high 80c, but working is 30‚Äôs. you lose very little perf by running it more in the zone. I don't know about other boards but that msi one sure makes it easy and the price if right.About the cpu: it has a ton of cores, I didn't need to buy ddr5--  i need quite a lot of ram and it still costs too much for the benefit it provides in my workload. The memory controller on 13gen is far better than ryzen 5000 series. I couldn't before get my ddr4 stable at 4000 on the 5900x and it did it on the intel one immediately. Indeed i was even able to tighten up the timings just a touch. So modern processors (and i'd assume the amd ones as well) have made welcome improvements to memory support. Id' say if you don't need as much ram say 32gb, and you don't have ddr4 already to tide you over i'd consider getting ddr5 though.  I mean nothing is cheaper than what you have and 4k speed is fine. If i had nothing or maybe some old ram i'd go w/ ddr5.Price: For 570 it‚Äôs decent deal here. It is more than i love spending, but for what you get it is a lot better than what amd is offering at the time i write this which was 700.I do wish intel supported board reuse down the line, but that even can. be overblown (to an extent, and only an extent) though it's a selling feature to me frankly reuse!! I had to really think about that. I don't understand why intel is so stubborn on this subject.  with my amd cpu i went from 2700x to 5900x and the board went from a 470 to 570 because i waned more io and better pcie but i also gave that board to my kid and upgraded it one time. With intel especially I mean i just buy cheap boards anyway and upgrade more because there are a ton of features that get added half the time. I usually try to spend about 150 on a board, though it. is getting harder but it would be more my preference. I 'm not really onboard with the 600 motherboards. Is there a  300 one in-between i guess so but that's equally unappealing to me esp w/ out the upgrade.Tips/A rant if you will: trust me on this that msi board for 159 is so amazing. It really works great. don‚Äôt worry about the vrm. that‚Äôs also very overblown too. you can go calculate the amperage this will not come close. ALso msi is a great brand and the bios is easy to navigate. If you want fancy audio buy a dac that you can reuse and plug into usb and keep reusing it. Just think about what you really need in there. The msi board has a nice selection of pcie slots and well placed nvme. I use multiple gpu one nvidia gpu quatro for encoding (its a small one) and and amd one 6900 i bought for 570 for gaming. I just really love the layout connectivity and features of the board. They cut all the stuff i don't need and pared with the cpu it's all together about 700 for a cpu and board, pretty much as good as you can get.","Reviewed in the United States on 16 November 2022","IntelCore i9-13900KF Desktop Processor 24 cores (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) 36M Cache up to 5.8 GHz' Socket LGA 1700","",""

"elviscera","4","","Concerning Intel Core i9-13900KF,I have this CPU with board ASUS ROG Strix Z790-E Gaming WiFi 6E LGA 1700 for gaming usage.  Once I discovered that I had to slow the memory down from the 6600MHz XMP rating to 6200MHz, the board/cpu combo has worked very reliably  (multiple passes of OCCT Gold stress test).  Just checking the XMP II box,  the 6200MHz box and the (so called) AI overclocking box in the bios gives a score of 40K on Cinebench R23 so it's plenty fast -- the loss of 400MHz memory bandwidth isn't a big deal.  I tried various other adjustments but the latter turned out to be sufficiently fast and very reliable.  My current chip has a Silicon Predictor(SP) of 99 (roll of the dice).  I suspect that higher SP levels while possible are rare.I am using a ARCTIC Liquid Freezer II 360  AIO which works OK but the CPU can run hot.  The mother board cooling prediction for said AIO is 155 but that is not really enough for this chip to run all out.  It is easy to get this CPU up to 100C using OCT Power Stress test.  While the CPU might run at 100C for a long time, it will not do it any good and it will not run reliably -- I needed to check the 90C max box in the bios to get it to pass the OCCT power stress test.  I have a RTX 4090 and in the OCCT power test the net system power gets up to 1100W.  Normal gaming so far never gets to such power levels but still worth considering.FWIW, I have had a CPU apparently fail from running the OCCT Power Stress test.  If you want to run this CPU all out with reasonable temps, you really need significant cooling.  I doubt any AIO will work for this.  I suggest an open loop system with something like a Watercool MO-RA3 420 PRO radiator.All said, If you are building a gaming system, you would be just as well served with a ASUS ROG Strix Z690-E and a i9-12900KF CPU.  It will be easier to cool and will save you some money for a better graphics card which will make *much* more difference in most games than the CPU.","Reviewed in the United States on 21 June 2023","IntelCore i9-13900KF Desktop Processor 24 cores (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) 36M Cache up to 5.8 GHz' Socket LGA 1700","",""

"Customer 2023","5","","It's fast, and works better than my space heater for keeping the desk undersides warm. Too warm, really.UPS says the computer is using 575 watts during the CPU stress test, about 175 watts at idle. TPU is 253w ... so with the 80%+ PS inefficiency, 300w makes sense.When using the 3080 GPU with the i9 CPU ... well, the heat coming from the case is similar to a 1000w space heater, really. Now reconsidering my choice for only an 850w PS. 1000w would probably be a better idea for this beast.As for speed. That's relative. But I am coming from an i9-7900x, and this is 3x faster, and it feels 3x faster. Memory is slower, (4ch vs 2ch) -- so I had to use DDR5-6400 to get a similar memory bandwidth. Lost some latency, but the overall effect is the thing still seems plenty fast.I dislike the way the CPU case instantly jumps to 100c -- no thermal mass what-so-ever in the CPU case. Or I have a bad CPU without whatever filler Intel puts between the die and the case.In any case, Intel needs to allow for more thermal mass to reduce these thermal stresses of instantaneous temp changes. Has to be stressing the silicon and lead to more thermal stress failures.","Reviewed in the United States on 6 April 2023","IntelCore i9-13900KF Desktop Processor 24 cores (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) 36M Cache up to 5.8 GHz' Socket LGA 1700","",""

"Mas","1","","This is my experience, I doubt that this is actually a problem with the processor itself, and more compatibility issue of the motherboard that I put it on, but I expected because it ran on 400 and 500 series motherboards that that meant that since mine is a 400 that it would run on it, I was wrong, the PC would not post when I put this processor on, I tried exchanging for another, and it did the same thing PC would not boot at all, it would go into a turn on then off then on then off then on then off then on then off cycle where nothing would actually show up on the monitor just my case fans would light up and then turn off and then light up and then turn off. So I don't know if the problem is with the processor or if I have a board compatibility issue, but I think I should not have had a board compatibility issue, and I have a 900 W power supply so there's no reason why there wasn't enough power to boot, I also used a liquid cooler so it should have had zero heat problems. I put a 12,900K on my motherboard from a 12700 KF which is what came with the computer, and the 12900K boots just fine. I am running a Lenovo legion t5 Gen 7.

"Roenin","4","","The best processor in 2022-2023 for those who want to both video games and to work. Unfortunately also with undervolting as efficiency is a disaster, in gaming comes to consume 3-4 times more than it should.When I watch a movie, the maximum frequency to me by consuming 25-30 Watt in Idle or almost, I had to bang me to make personalized energy profiles with QuickCpu to have acceptable consumption, but they are still uncomfortable to change for eachGame and application, even with PowerPlanswitcher. The fault is also of Windows that does not help, because it does not climb the frequency based on consumption. Then I have also noticed that Windows prefers to use the p-cores HT rather than the e-coresBy increasing the inefficiency and thus also causing the drops in performance since logical cores are much less powerful than efficient cores. As overclocking there is nothing to do, the best to stay in PL2 and Tmax 90 ¬∞ in full is 5.8GHzOut of 2-3 cores, 5.7GHz out of 7 cores and 5.5ghz on all P-cores, however setting it thus becomes more inefficient coi processes that require less cores. I noticed that the CPU has a 5.3ghz Sweet spot in which the performance, efficiency and temperatures are much better, so one of the power plans that I did with Quickcpu limits the clock to this frequency. The most positive thing is that compared to AMD it is possible to overclock the memory and increase the performance of 10-15% in the apps and in the games that use so much and thus making the CPU becomes more efficient since the memories consume a few watts and speed up computational performance and the difference with the 3D Vcache of AMD is filled in the applications in which it hasThe best. I have over 6667 CL32 to have this result with the VDD Safe at 1,435V and I lowered secondary and tertiary timing, be careful that if you don't do an overclocking as you should have no benefit, it is stuffMuch for Smonettoni, between 4800 CL40 Stocks and 7200 CL34 stock will change only by 5%. As trial game at the end of overclocking I used rust which is among the games that benefit from more than the ram and fast cache and the difference is impressive, they areBecause of 115 fps with the XMP 5200 Stock profile at 135 fps with 6667 CL32. Probardably with a high -end motherboard and the RAM with Die that reach 8600mHz you can do better, but the important thing is the best compromise between frequency and timings. Take the F version because it is useless, it does not make sense of existing, the integrated GPU is worth ‚Ç¨ 50, the pay almost nothing and when needed it is always ready there, I have connected the second monitor and Intel's Quick Sync to recordAnd elaborating videos is good, it consumes very little 1-10watt, does not affect temperatures, you can deactivate it when you want and it is extremely useful even in the event of a dedicated failure.","Reviewed in Italy on 2 November 2023","Intel Core I9-13900K Processor 36M Cache Up to 5.80 Ghz LGA 1700","",""

"Zugidor","5","","Best high end CPU for the money (as of time of writing this review, the 7950X3D is more expensive, not as widely available, and has strange gimmicks with Xbox Game Bar, so I avoided it). Despite all the news of it running extremely hot and hitting 300W, you can actually change this in your BIOS. On my Asus board, the default setting boosts it to ~310W for a short while causing 102¬∞C on my 360mm Arctic AIO before dropping to something more reasonable. YOU CAN DISABLE THIS and enforce Intel stock 250W limits. Doing this led to no throttling and no crazy 100¬∞C moments. This is not an inferno of a chip, your motherboard makes it one, so carefully check your BIOS settings if that bothers you!I'm happy that this chip does phenomenally in gaming and productivity both, so I can easily recommend it.

It adds more cores, larger cache, much faster memory and sky high frequencies.

In my case just using AI tuning, the ""out of the box"" clocks I got were 6100ghz with 1.390v stable (both of these numbers will improve with custom overclocking).The temps are 34-39c idle and a max gaming temp in the area of 58-64c, those temps are with a Lian-Li Galahad 360 AIO cooler and TG kryonaut Extreme thermal paste.Total power consumption in every day usage and gaming never exceed 130 watt and total system power draw (Including a 4090) in everyday usage is around 140-145 watt (picture included on power supply maximum draw).","Reviewed in Germany on 5 December 2022","Intel Core I9-13900K Processor 36M Cache Up to 5.80 Ghz LGA 1700","",""

I am using liquid cooling on top of this. And yet it hit 80¬∞C. What I was doing when that happened was trying to open a game.

But until that switch happened, under less than a minute of CPU usage, it reached to 80¬∞c. I mean since these are premium products, there should be some protection layers blocking such usages, and close the programs instead rather than hitting its performance.But anyways, I disabled the integrated device and then it's all smooth.

"Erik Gerlitz","1","","My first review ever. Intel has finally acknowledged this issue, search ""Regarding Reports of 13th/14th Gen Unlocked Desktop Users Experiencing Stability Issues"" on google.For me, worked great for about a month, then slowly started experiencing stability issues. Games would crash and get an occasional blue screen. After about 6 months, there were noticeable stability issues, with many games unable to boot past main menu, causing blue screen on launch, or experiencing frequent crashes. Friends in separate friend groups would always comment on my computer issues, showing bugs and crashes that have no apparent causes.After a year, my PC can only run super smash brothers melee with stability and even chrome tabs are crashing now. Discord has to be run on chrome because the app crashes every 10 seconds, I can't play any games. I had dedicated tens of hours into investigating only to realize it's been the CPU all along. I also had to upgrade my motherboard to accommodate this CPU and now I have to investigate if this CPU has caused irreparable damage to the motherboard. I expect Intel will be facing heavy financial losses due to influx of warranties as the issues become more and more public.Please look up ""Intel 13th and 14th Gen stability"" for more info, or ""Intel Raptor Lake stability"" on Google for further cases.

"Carlos Canales","3","","So, first thing's first. This is a genuinely powerful CPU that's been able to handle basically every task that I've thrown at it. It runs demanding tasks like encoding and gaming with ease.Now with that out of the way; Thermals. This thing gets hot, and I mean REALLY hot. If you're going with air cooling I strongly recommend a double tower, six/eight pipe Air cooler like the Corsair A115 or a Cooler Master MA824. If you are going the AIO route, anything LESS than a 360mm AIO will under perform. For that, go with any 360mm AIO from any brand of your choice. If you have the space, go with a 420mm AIO for the best results.Finally, there has been recent reports of CPU degradation and instability when using this CPU. I am using this with an asus ROG STRIX Z790-H motherboard and it basically JUICED the CPU like no tomorrow until I applied intel's Power settings for this CPU. This likely is the cause of the degradation. Be sure to check intel's website for recommended power settings. Also check your motherboard vendor for any bios updates as Intel has confirmed that many motherboard vendors are running the i9 13900k CPU out of intel's specifications.In conclusion here's my personal experience: The CPU functions, but I can not use Asus' AI Overclocking feature as I get a BSOD with the CLOCK_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT error and apps will randomly crash. You probably shouldn't use any AI assisted overclocking feature if you can help it. Even running this at stock, there is still a substantial amount of performance in this CPU. If you have an older rig and are looking to upgrade your CPU, I would just wait for Meteorlake or just go with AMD.Final note: I am not using a contact frame on my motherboard for my CPU.","Reviewed in the United States on 26 May 2024","Intel Core i9-13900K Desktop Processor LGA 1700 24 cores (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) 36M Cache up to 5.8 GHz","",""

"Adam White","5","","I got this and a new DDR5 motherboard with Z690 chipset.  It didn't boot when I set it all up.  It turns out the Z690 needs a BIOS update to work with this CPU.  Luckily I had an older i7 that worked on this motherboard.  I dropped it in and it booted, then I did the BIOS update.  After that it boots this CPU just fine.Before this I was a die-hard AMD supporter.  I had 5950x with 16 cores, 32 threads, and 72MB of cache.  But, it just doesn't compete with this i9.  I haven't tried the 7950x, but I read that the P-cores just blow away the AMD cores.  Even with less cache.  The setup of 8 performance cores, and 16 efficiency cores just works.  It stays much cooler than earlier i9's and the AMD.  I use a water cooler, but it's not required.  Nothing slows this down when paired with DDR5.I wish the AMD was better, I like the company more.  But, I want the best of the best, and as of today there is nothing better than this available.  If you game, or do graphics, or anything on your PC this is the CPU for you.  It will NOT disappoint.A word on the X790 chipset.  You would think they will have better performance because they are newer.  They don't.  They will work with the i9 no matter what, while the Z690 might need a BIOS update.  They have one more USB port.  But otherwise there is no benefit to getting Z790 and they cost a LOT more.  So, if you have the ability to use an older CPU to flash the bios, or find one that is new enough that it doesn't need the update, this CPU will be great.","Reviewed in the United States on 22 February 2023","Intel Core i9-13900K Desktop Processor LGA 1700 24 cores (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) 36M Cache up to 5.8 GHz","",""

"Dr. B","5","","When it comes to going over the top for a PC upgrade, this CPU is the undisputed heavyweight champion. I, too, dabble in video editing, 3D modeling, and an array of demanding tasks, and let me tell you, this powerhouse just devours them with sheer gusto. Paired with a Kraken water cooler, it operates like a well-oiled machine, showing absolutely no signs of throttling, even under the most intense workloads. And as for those so-called ""CPU-intensive"" games, well, they might as well be child's play for this beast. If you're seeking the best of the best, look no further ‚Äì this CPU is the crown jewel in the kingdom of processors, and it's here to make your computing dreams come true.

"Nabil","5","","This processor is a beast especially paired with gtx 4090 graphics card. I can edit videos and play games both at 4K settings together no problem and it doesn‚Äôt generate that much heat either. I previously had a 2080ti paired with 6900k and was very happy with it until everyone was transitioning to 4K so sadly I had to retire my old build. Just a heads up to anyone who plans to pair 13900k with 4090, don‚Äôt be a smartass and try to put it in small case, you will regret it later. I personally recommend big case with high airflow like fractal design torrent mid size atx but if you don‚Äôt want to spend too much money on graphics card and happy with getting something like 4060 then you can get the nano version of fractal torrent.

"Pierre Aubert Espenan","5","","I bought two of these from Amazon after one from another vendor failed to POST.  Both worked the first time.  Do you need 24 cores for games?  Most games use 4 or 6 cores max, so probably not.  Video editing can benefit from the extra cores.  Intel supports XMP (extreme memory profile) and this processor is unlocked (it can be overclocked).  Overclocking increases the power consumption and heat; therefore, one needs a robust cooling solution.  Overclocking can void your warranty which is strange since Intel allows and even promotes overclocking with the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility.  I have the NZXT Kraken x 73 RGB liquid cooler.  With the NZXT CAM software you can see the CPU (and GPU) temperatures and control the fan speeds, reducing the risk of damaging the processor.  While idling (at 5.5 GHz) the CPU temperature is 30 C.  Under a 50% load or overclocked the temperatures are below 60 C.  Pros: Good for video editing Cons: A bit pricey for a gaming computer.

"Joaquin","5","","Excellent processor. It is a beast in gaming and in productivity, for the price I believe is unrivaled. Beware that you should separately buy a CPU Cooler because it does not come with one.Also beware that most Motherboards nowadays put no restraints to this processor in the BIOS, so they let it draw unlimited power and with that comes a very hot temperature limit. For example I'm using an 360mm AIO cooler and with the stock motherboard settings of my AORUS ELITE AX when running cinebench it reaches 100¬∞C within 12 seconds of starting. Of course this temperature is only seen in stress tests and never during games (there, the max I've seen the CPU get is 67¬∞C) but is something to be aware of.All in all happy with this beast","Reviewed in the United States on 29 May 2023","Intel Core i9-13900K Desktop Processor LGA 1700 24 cores (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) 36M Cache up to 5.8 GHz","",""

So, i go and pick up the machine.I try to file a warrenty claim with Intel, but their login system was broken for a week, so I had to chat with a support person.  We spend 1 hour typing about the issue.  I send him screenshots of the CPU itself, the text from Microcenter, the recepit from Amazon, screenshot of the Bios showing all my hardware information, a screenshot of the recepit from microcenter, a screenshot of the error code.I wait a week or so, i can finally log into Intel website, and i dont see a support ticket.  I open up chat again,  i tell them my ticket and they tell me that it wasnt assigned to an email address.  They assign it and forward the support response to me.And the response says, they cant contact Microcenter to confirm it.  And that its not a CPU issue anyways because that code is due to an OS issue.An OS issue.  I ask them to reiterate their point, because if its an OS issue, that means they dont believe me and Microcenter.

"Adam White","5","","I got this and a new DDR5 motherboard with Z690 chipset.  It didn't boot when I set it all up.  It turns out the Z690 needs a BIOS update to work with this CPU.  Luckily I had an older i7 that worked on this motherboard.  I dropped it in and it booted, then I did the BIOS update.  After that it boots this CPU just fine.Before this I was a die-hard AMD supporter.  I had 5950x with 16 cores, 32 threads, and 72MB of cache.  But, it just doesn't compete with this i9.  I haven't tried the 7950x, but I read that the P-cores just blow away the AMD cores.  Even with less cache.  The setup of 8 performance cores, and 16 efficiency cores just works.  It stays much cooler than earlier i9's and the AMD.  I use a water cooler, but it's not required.  Nothing slows this down when paired with DDR5.I wish the AMD was better, I like the company more.  But, I want the best of the best, and as of today there is nothing better than this available.  If you game, or do graphics, or anything on your PC this is the CPU for you.  It will NOT disappoint.A word on the X790 chipset.  You would think they will have better performance because they are newer.  They don't.

"Real Reviews","5","","I really like this CPU and it has worked well for my needs. Many had the issue of overheating, throttling and even bending in some instances. I have not experienced any of this since I knew exactly what settings needed adjusted in the BIOS to keep this monster CPU running cool. It seems that motherboard manufacturers tend to turn these up way past their limits by default and that was what caused all the issues. All you need to to is look up the specs for your CPU and setup the BIOS of your motherboard accordingly.I am using the Aorus Waterforce X 280 with Artic MX-6 Thermal Paste just in case you are curious.

I can edit videos and play games both at 4K settings together no problem and it doesn‚Äôt generate that much heat either. I previously had a 2080ti paired with 6900k and was very happy with it until everyone was transitioning to 4K so sadly I had to retire my old build.

I personally recommend big case with high airflow like fractal design torrent mid size atx but if you don‚Äôt want to spend too much money on graphics card and happy with getting something like 4060 then you can get the nano version of fractal torrent.

"Pierre Aubert Espenan","5","","I bought two of these from Amazon after one from another vendor failed to POST.  Both worked the first time.  Do you need 24 cores for games?  Most games use 4 or 6 cores max, so probably not.  Video editing can benefit from the extra cores.  Intel supports XMP (extreme memory profile) and this processor is unlocked (it can be overclocked).  Overclocking increases the power consumption and heat; therefore, one needs a robust cooling solution.  Overclocking can void your warranty which is strange since Intel allows and even promotes overclocking with the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility.  I have the NZXT Kraken x 73 RGB liquid cooler.  With the NZXT CAM software you can see the CPU (and GPU) temperatures and control the fan speeds, reducing the risk of damaging the processor.  While idling (at 5.5 GHz) the CPU temperature is 30 C.  Under a 50% load or overclocked the temperatures are below 60 C.  Pros: Good for video editing Cons: A bit pricey for a gaming computer.

Beware that you should separately buy a CPU Cooler because it does not come with one.Also beware that most Motherboards nowadays put no restraints to this processor in the BIOS, so they let it draw unlimited power and with that comes a very hot temperature limit.

"Srimanth","3","It can be more efficient I guess","It is working almost same as my 10 yr old DELL XPS laptop, swapped with a SATA SSD, and i7 second gen processor. I don't know whats improved. But it's doing its job I guess.. in my 2 weeks of usage I have seen it's temprature rised above 80¬∞C once. Wasn't expecting that from current refined and powerful generations. I am using liquid cooling on top of this. And yet it hit 80¬∞C. What I was doing when that happened was trying to open a game. And one thing that I missed was to disable the integrated graphics because I have dedicated GPU. It was just for a moment the CPU was used during the game launch and after it started using the GPU. But until that switch happened, under less than a minute of CPU usage, it reached to 80¬∞c. I mean since these are premium products, there should be some protection layers blocking such usages, and close the programs instead rather than hitting its performance.But anyways, I disabled the integrated device and then it's all smooth. Everything normal except for that one instance explained above. Parallel processing is still shitty though with Windows OS.

Intel has finally acknowledged this issue, search ""Regarding Reports of 13th/14th Gen Unlocked Desktop Users Experiencing Stability Issues"" on google.For me, worked great for about a month, then slowly started experiencing stability issues. Games would crash and get an occasional blue screen. After about 6 months, there were noticeable stability issues, with many games unable to boot past main menu, causing blue screen on launch, or experiencing frequent crashes. Friends in separate friend groups would always comment on my computer issues, showing bugs and crashes that have no apparent causes.After a year, my PC can only run super smash brothers melee with stability and even chrome tabs are crashing now. Discord has to be run on chrome because the app crashes every 10 seconds, I can't play any games. I had dedicated tens of hours into investigating only to realize it's been the CPU all along. I also had to upgrade my motherboard to accommodate this CPU and now I have to investigate if this CPU has caused irreparable damage to the motherboard. I expect Intel will be facing heavy financial losses due to influx of warranties as the issues become more and more public.Please look up ""Intel 13th and 14th Gen stability"" for more info, or ""Intel Raptor Lake stability"" on Google for further cases.

"Carlos Canales","3","","So, first thing's first. This is a genuinely powerful CPU that's been able to handle basically every task that I've thrown at it. It runs demanding tasks like encoding and gaming with ease.Now with that out of the way; Thermals. This thing gets hot, and I mean REALLY hot. If you're going with air cooling I strongly recommend a double tower, six/eight pipe Air cooler like the Corsair A115 or a Cooler Master MA824. If you are going the AIO route, anything LESS than a 360mm AIO will under perform. For that, go with any 360mm AIO from any brand of your choice. If you have the space, go with a 420mm AIO for the best results.Finally, there has been recent reports of CPU degradation and instability when using this CPU. I am using this with an asus ROG STRIX Z790-H motherboard and it basically JUICED the CPU like no tomorrow until I applied intel's Power settings for this CPU. This likely is the cause of the degradation. Be sure to check intel's website for recommended power settings. Also check your motherboard vendor for any bios updates as Intel has confirmed that many motherboard vendors are running the i9 13900k CPU out of intel's specifications.In conclusion here's my personal experience: The CPU functions, but I can not use Asus' AI Overclocking feature as I get a BSOD with the CLOCK_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT error and apps will randomly crash. You probably shouldn't use any AI assisted overclocking feature if you can help it. Even running this at stock, there is still a substantial amount of performance in this CPU. If you have an older rig and are looking to upgrade your CPU, I would just wait for Meteorlake or just go with AMD.Final note: I am not using a contact frame on my motherboard for my CPU.","Reviewed in the United States on 26 May 2024","Intel Core i9-13900K Desktop Processor LGA 1700 24 cores (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) 36M Cache up to 5.8 GHz","",""

I reset the OS, still issues, I do a fresh clean install, still issues.  I try replacing the memory, still issues.  I try installing win 11 with a different boot installer, still issues.  I try windows 10.... still issues.  I try reinstalling it 2 more times, still the same issue.I decide to go to Micro Center to have them diagnose the issue, while i am there, their windows 10 install crashes with the same error code.  They take it in, and in 2 days message me saying its the CPU.  They tried the CPU in a different motherboard and the issue still shows up.  So, i go and pick up the machine.I try to file a warrenty claim with Intel, but their login system was broken for a week, so I had to chat with a support person.  We spend 1 hour typing about the issue.  I send him screenshots of the CPU itself, the text from Microcenter, the recepit from Amazon, screenshot of the Bios showing all my hardware information, a screenshot of the recepit from microcenter, a screenshot of the error code.I wait a week or so, i can finally log into Intel website, and i dont see a support ticket.  I open up chat again,  i tell them my ticket and they tell me that it wasnt assigned to an email address.  They assign it and forward the support response to me.And the response says, they cant contact Microcenter to confirm it.  And that its not a CPU issue anyways because that code is due to an OS issue.An OS issue.  I ask them to reiterate their point, because if its an OS issue, that means they dont believe me and Microcenter.  I also pointed out again that i have installed Windows 10 and 11 at least 5 times.... and they respond with, i need documentation from Microcenter.  So, they dont believe me and they believe this is an OS issue still.It has been 11 days and they wont move forward unless I send the documentation from Micro Center now.Works great, but hope you never have to file a warrenty claim because its going to take at least a month and thats if your lucky.","Reviewed in the United States on 2 July 2023","Intel Core i9-13900K Desktop Processor LGA 1700 24 cores (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) 36M Cache up to 5.8 GHz","",""

"DUBNASTY","5","","The Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i9-14900KS Desktop Processor arrives with much anticipation, boasting impressive specifications on paper. However, a closer examination reveals that this processor falls short of delivering the expected value for its price tag.At first glance, the i9-14900KS appears promising, with its high clock speeds and purported performance enhancements. However, when put to the test, it becomes evident that the marginal improvements over its predecessors do not justify the hefty price premium attached to it.One of the major drawbacks of the i9-14900KS is its lackluster performance gains in real-world scenarios. Despite the incremental upgrades in clock speeds and architecture, users may find that the difference in performance compared to previous generations is negligible in most tasks, from gaming to content creation.Moreover, the i9-14900KS faces stiff competition from rival processors, such as those from AMD's Ryzen lineup, which offer comparable performance at a more reasonable price point. In terms of value for money, the i9-14900KS simply does not measure up, as consumers can find better alternatives that provide similar or even superior performance without breaking the bank.Furthermore, the i9-14900KS's power consumption and thermal management remain areas of concern. Despite being marketed as a high-performance processor, it tends to run hot under heavy workloads, requiring robust cooling solutions to prevent thermal throttling and maintain stable operation.In conclusion, while the Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i9-14900KS Desktop Processor may appeal to enthusiasts seeking the latest and greatest hardware, its lack of significant performance improvements and unfavorable price-to-performance ratio makes it a hard sell for the average consumer. With more cost-effective options available on the market, investing in the i9-14900KS may not be the wisest decision for those looking to maximize their computing power without breaking the bank.","Reviewed in the United States on 30 March 2024","Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i9-14900KS Desktop Processor 24 cores (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores)","",""

Yes, IMC (Integrated Memory Controller) does matter when it comes to RAM overclocking, however, not all RAM and CPU can achieve same clockspeed and volage due to silicon lottery.

"Amazon lover","5","","So far so good.  This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.  My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen.","Reviewed in the United States on 3 November 2023","Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i9-14900KF New Gaming Desktop Processor 24 cores (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) - Unlocked","",""

I originally purchased the i9 13900k, did no overclocking but had soooo much trouble with the system that I stupidly replaced the mainboard and video card.  I didn't refund as I assumed that I had done the damage.  Literally months of troubleshooting and doubled expenses before I realized that the asus mainboard defaulted to super high wattage and the chip itself began to degrade at an extremely fast rate.  Yet again assuming that I must have done something wrong I ordered this replacement chip, to find issues suddenly occuring again.  This is about when the news dropped on mainboard suppliers and intel passing the buck on an inherently co dependant series of faults that have personally cost thousands upon thousands of dollars.I'm an IT professional, have been in the industry for more than 20 years, and have never encountered a situation so costly for the end consumer.I really hate to say it, I hold stocks in intel, I've loved them as a brand and considered them to be a number one choice, I can no longer say this.I honestly think there should be a class action lawsuit over this chip and it's predecessorI had to purchase 2  rtx 4090 and 2 asus mainboards before I could even lock down this issue.I hate to say it but if I'd gone with a competitor I would have saved multiple thousands of dollars.","Reviewed in Canada on 3 May 2024","Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i9-14900KF New Gaming Desktop Processor 24 cores (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) - Unlocked","",""

"Deven","5","","This professional CPU isn't designed for the average user. However, if you're a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube ""videos"" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I've acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailers‚ÄîBest Buy, Newegg, and others included.For those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fans‚ÄîAvoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics.When selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn't your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank.The 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouse‚Äîachieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It's a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns...Did I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40¬∞C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50¬∞C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I'd advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methods‚Äîincreased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true.As of this date‚Äî4-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that's a discussion for another time.The X3D Elephant in the room: Don't worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias...We'll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults.""Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there's no cause for concern. Let's briefly touch on the ""benefits"" like reduced thermals and supposed platform longevity (as if motherboard chipset upgrades and advancements in power delivery methods don't occur... humor me, over the planned 6 years). I, too, long for Z390 features on my Z790 board (/end sarcasm), not to mention the potential for longer boot times when tinkering with DDR5 or PBO, or even under normal conditions, and texture stutter/tearing... oops, and all those other delightful topics Lisa tends to highlight without addressing the influence of influencers with communications degrees rather than computer science degrees.  Just having fun, do what you love!I don't blame Amazon, Intel, AMD, or Nvidia more than the other. Manufacturing and shipping issues happen. The chip I received from Amazon didn't meet my expectations, but my other purchases have been exceptional.

"Austin","5","","A lot of people are upset with the 14900k because of the minimal performance leap thar came between it and the 13900k. I say who cares. If you have a 13900k, don't upgrade, but if you have an older PC or 12th Gen, this is a worthy upgrade. I absolutely love mine. It's a monster of a CPU.I honestly don't recommend air cooling it. It can get pretty hot and there are only a small handful of air coolers that can handle this 14900k without setting power limits (which most people don't know how to do, let alone even know what that means)If you're not doing a custom water loop to cool your 14900k, I recommend you do what I've done to cool mine, you dont neeeed to, but it helps. I have an AIO (All-In-One Cooler) and I setup a push-pull configuration on my radiator. That means I have 3 fans on the bottom blowing in through the radiator, and 3 more fans blowing up and out of the case. Both are blowing upward. It creates more airflow. One side is pushing the air, the other side is helping pull that air through. Then I got a thermalright contact frame. Any LGA 1700 contact frame should work but the thermalright version is cheap. It might say 12th/13th Gen but it will also work on 14th Gen. So get an AIO, setup a push-pull fan configuration and get a contact frame. It's helping my Temps significantly. I typically stay in the high 50's or low 60's during 4K gaming. This CPU draws a ton of power so you might see it bump up to 80‚Å∞ occasionally, for a very brief moment.

"J","4","","I built 3 systems using 14900 series. They all had serious stability problems when in use.  After researching for weeks and reinstalling OS with no better result.  I finally disabled overclocking ""AI overclocking"", which was running as high as 1.6v.  I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE.  this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully.  It basically throttles the chip.I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out.  Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine.  I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive.  It does run HOT even with water cooling.  IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5.  Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips.Here's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use.  Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing.  HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300.  So a small advantage in Adobe CS is why I went with the 14900K vs KF.System was using ""AI overclocking"" pushing it to 6.2 roughly single core.  Disabled in BIOS now.Specs: Asus z290a Wifi II, Corsair 96GB DDR5 5600, Samsung 990 Pro, CPU Water cooled, 3080tiSo the ""K"" is basically useless for me at this point and don't see myself doing it manually as it's just not worth it to me.

"JZ the reviewer","5","","I'm not going to go over the same performance reviews others have done, yes its very fast for only $550 its the king of the poor mans build PC. my last PC its replacing was a $1000 10980xe and looking at the numbers the 14900k in average is 70-77% faster than the 10980xe. the only disadvantage between the 2 was the 10980xe had 48 PCIe lanes and ran 32c to 56c hot.i can't say the same about the 14900k heat, its spreader is almost half of the 10980xe. you can't just simply add a stock cooler or a ""MC'watercooler"" and expect the problem will solve itself. this is the first CPU in my 26 yrs of building PC's you have to plan out your cooler set up.ever since a 2012 water leak from these Mc'watercoolers (all in one 2 fan radiator kits sold by name brands) Ive never trusted them cost me $1500 in damages. The only water coolers that don't leak for me were the ones i built but water cooling is expensive and you have to inspect them at least every 3 months for debris in the tank or leaks. with air i only have to clean the pc 2x a year.yes you can control temps with an air cooler, and get the same temps as a 3 fan radiator water cooler. I'll post the results without adding a watt limit in the mobo post screen.here is the parts i bought to air cool running the new cinabench 2024 for 30 mins i can get max performance on a defualt non OC not hitting above 99C on the P cores1. Noctua NH-D15 chromax.Black | Dual-Tower CPU Cooler | 140mm | Black2. Noctua NF-A15 HS-PWM chromax.Black.swap (this adds a 3rd fan for the air cooler you'll need it)3.

Thermalright Intel 12th/13th Generation LGA1700 Anti-Bending Buckle ( a must add a little thermal grease on the cpu side flaps this buckle is 100% aluminum will al help dissipate heat.then i went to my mother board software options (mobo is an MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX) select ""CPU cooler tuning"" select ""tower air cooling"" which will limit the wattage draw to under 300w also note if you are not using a Water Cooling Reservoir  you should also use this option, water cooling a 14900k and OC really does require a reservoir, and a 4x 120 fan size radiator if you're simply using a pre-built 2x fan radiator its not enough to handle the 14900k and the CPU is known for drawing 370w plus!!so using air cooled i got a 2371 score with no watt limiter option an temps were 78-100c on the p cores, and with the 300 watt limit the score was  2328 with temps 70-99c never hit 100c case the limiter would kick in. (note this is from CPU testing that punishes the CPU realistically i don't see this CPU going over 88c even on the most demanding game in 3 years.i personally do not recommend OC this CPU its already been pushed to its limits by INTEL at best for another 100 watts when all you're getting is 3-4 more FPS and that's not worth it. and all these people bragging a 6.2-6.5ghz OC, there just flexing for clout, then they take the CPU back to default. i already have my P cores spiking to 6.002 at 288-300 watts, and under 99c temps; adding 0.198mhz will meaning nothing for apps and gaming.personal note the MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX Gaming Motherboard is absolutely amazing at squeezing out all the performance of the 14900k worth the $700 price never crashed during testing that 26 power phases is godly  compared to my last gen EVGA x299 dark had 12 phase...RIP EGA :(","Reviewed in the United States on 11 February 2024","Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i9-14900KF New Gaming Desktop Processor 24 cores (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) - Unlocked","",""

"Eric E.","5","","So I finally upgraded my home workstation, and went to this new i9-14900K. It is incredibly fast. I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.! Also, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly. Applications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build. The one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims. With this new cpu, I can only run 2 GPU's and they run at 8x, cause they share the 16x, and that does leave me 4 full pcie4.0 lanes for the system drive. It is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it. One thing EVERYBODY should be aware of, is these new intel chips have P cores and E cores. Something my old cpu did NOT have. E-cores can severely impact certain software performance. When I booted up the new machine and tried my Ableton DAW  for the first time, I was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost, and the software was literally almost unusable.! The E-cores were slowing the software down so bad, I could barely change settings in the preferences.! It was that bad. I had to install process lasso ( fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it ) and disable the use of E-cores for Ableton and then it worked very fast and is great.!","Reviewed in the United States on 19 March 2024","Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i9-14900KF New Gaming Desktop Processor 24 cores (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) - Unlocked","",""

My station is primarily used as a work station though it scores well with PC Mark 10 and cinebench. 3D Mark declares the obvious that I need to upgrade my video card from several years ago. The ai over clocking helps in the bench marking significantly. Lot easier to overclock than in the early 2000's on my core 2quad. Enjoying my thermal right air cooler it does a great job for half the cost of my older noctua cooler on my prior haswell i7.","Reviewed in the United States on 5 April 2024","Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i9-14900KF New Gaming Desktop Processor 24 cores (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) - Unlocked","",""

"elviscera","3","","Once they came down in price, I did get a i9-14900K as an ""upgrade"" from a i9-13900KF to  i9-14900K .  It's OK but I can't rave over it.  It is more of an sideways change rather than an upgrade.The i9-14900K is fast but not more so that a i9-13900K.  For me, the Cinebench R23 scores are about the same for 13th versus 14th gen.  Though the i9-14900K appears to run DDR5 more stably and at higher frequencies than the i9-13900K.  Also, the i9-14900K is enabled for XTU AI enable tuning in XTU but it's not that helpful.  I even wonder if it is worth getting a K at all, these CPU's are plenty fast for gaming without overclocking.I did NOT notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures.  Maybe a slight improvement but I did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so I am doubtful that the running temps are better.  Also, I suggest that you NOT let these chips get anywhere near TjMax (100C).  I had one i9-13900KF literally fail due to allowing it to get to TjMax frequently when stress testing.  A second one became slightly flaky.I thought the built in ARC display support of the K version might be helpful since I intended to devote the graphics card to the gaming monitor and use the built-in ARC on a side display.  But as it turns out, it wasn't worth it for me.  If you are gaming with this level of processor, you really need a comparable graphics card but most of them will drive four displays.  IMO, you are better off getting a KF and spending the money so saved on better graphics card.The original asking price was insane, I bought it on a whim on a late night.  On the morning morning after, I had buyers remorse, tried to cancel but could not, so instead, I refused the package.  It took literally 6 months to get a refund.  That was rather irksome.","Reviewed in the United States on 5 April 2024","Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i9-14900KF New Gaming Desktop Processor 24 cores (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) - Unlocked","",""

While doing benchmarks, a few Pcores would hit 100c while others would hit 92c. Ecores was about 87c and low of 83c on 4.3Ghz all Pcore and 4.2Ghz all Ecore. Offset voltage was at 0.3. After switching back to auto clock, I still managed the same temps, but getting 5.1-5.2Ghz on Pcore and 4.3 on Ecore. If my case allowed 120mm fans, I would of most definitely installed 240mm AIO cooler. That for sure would of helped with the temps and get me higher benchmark numbers.When it came to rendering a 20 minute 4k video on sony Vegas Pro 18 (IGPU only), it took about 15 minutes to complete it vs my I9 9900k that would of taken over an hour to finish it (RTX 3060). This system was meant specifically VR/light video editing. So, considering how fast it is on the rendering without a dedicated GPU, I am pretty excited about it.

"Another Customer","5","","Sorta came from a 13900k but I gave that to a relative after their x299/i9-7940x system began to have issues. He bought a z790 board and was amazed how far ahead the 13900k is in comparison an overclocked Skylake-X processor. He fixed the issue with the x299 system, but he decided to stay with Raptor Lake. All of which is okay by me because that old 13900k had no overclocking headroom, and I could only undervolt it by 5mv before it became unstable. I was going to buy another 13900k or maybe the ks version, but I decided to wait for the 14900k.The 14900k I got on the other hand has some overclocking headroom. I already set all P-cores to 5.8GHz, while keeping the double-core Turbo Boost at 6.0GHz. I also set the cache to 5.2Ghz and it's completely stable. I was not able to raise the multiplier at all with my 13900k. Just happy my 14900k isn't a lottery loser.While the clock of both the 13900ks and 14900k are the same, the 13900ks has a cherry picked memory controller. If you're looking to do a ton of RAM overclocking then the 13900ks may be the way to go.... but that's not to say if you'd get a 14900k with a good memory controller. Both my 13900k and 14900k work with DDR5-7200 RAM with XMP set, and no adjustments to the memory controller voltages.If you're buying the 14900k off the get-go and building a new system around it, then I recommend pairing it with a motherboard that has the BIOS Flashback feature.","Reviewed in the United States on 22 October 2023","Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i9-14900KF New Gaming Desktop Processor 24 cores (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) - Unlocked","",""

Multitasking, gaming, and content creation have all seen a significant improvement. Multithreaded applications and gaming experiences run smoother.  It's a productivity powerhouse. The clock speeds are no slouch either, making it excellent for single-threaded tasks and gaming. The major downside of this CPU is the heat it generates. Even with a high-end cooling solution, it tends to run hot, and that's something you must take into consideration when setting up your cooling solution.

"Amazon lover","5","","So far so good.  This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.  My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen.","Reviewed in the United States on 3 November 2023","Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i9-14900K New Gaming Desktop Processor 24 cores (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked","",""

I've acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailers‚ÄîBest Buy, Newegg, and others included.For those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fans‚ÄîAvoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics.When selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn't your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank.The 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouse‚Äîachieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It's a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns...Did I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40¬∞C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50¬∞C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I'd advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methods‚Äîincreased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU.

If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults.""Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there's no cause for concern.

If you have a 13900k, don't upgrade, but if you have an older PC or 12th Gen, this is a worthy upgrade. I absolutely love mine. It's a monster of a CPU.I honestly don't recommend air cooling it. It can get pretty hot and there are only a small handful of air coolers that can handle this 14900k without setting power limits (which most people don't know how to do, let alone even know what that means)If you're not doing a custom water loop to cool your 14900k, I recommend you do what I've done to cool mine, you dont neeeed to, but it helps. I have an AIO (All-In-One Cooler) and I setup a push-pull configuration on my radiator. That means I have 3 fans on the bottom blowing in through the radiator, and 3 more fans blowing up and out of the case. Both are blowing upward. It creates more airflow. One side is pushing the air, the other side is helping pull that air through. Then I got a thermalright contact frame. Any LGA 1700 contact frame should work but the thermalright version is cheap. It might say 12th/13th Gen but it will also work on 14th Gen. So get an AIO, setup a push-pull fan configuration and get a contact frame. It's helping my Temps significantly.

"J","4","","I built 3 systems using 14900 series. They all had serious stability problems when in use.  After researching for weeks and reinstalling OS with no better result.  I finally disabled overclocking ""AI overclocking"", which was running as high as 1.6v.  I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE.  this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully.  It basically throttles the chip.I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out.  Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine.  I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive.  It does run HOT even with water cooling.  IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5.  Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips.Here's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use.  Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing.  HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300.

"JZ the reviewer","5","","I'm not going to go over the same performance reviews others have done, yes its very fast for only $550 its the king of the poor mans build PC. my last PC its replacing was a $1000 10980xe and looking at the numbers the 14900k in average is 70-77% faster than the 10980xe. the only disadvantage between the 2 was the 10980xe had 48 PCIe lanes and ran 32c to 56c hot.i can't say the same about the 14900k heat, its spreader is almost half of the 10980xe. you can't just simply add a stock cooler or a ""MC'watercooler"" and expect the problem will solve itself. this is the first CPU in my 26 yrs of building PC's you have to plan out your cooler set up.ever since a 2012 water leak from these Mc'watercoolers (all in one 2 fan radiator kits sold by name brands) Ive never trusted them cost me $1500 in damages. The only water coolers that don't leak for me were the ones i built but water cooling is expensive and you have to inspect them at least every 3 months for debris in the tank or leaks. with air i only have to clean the pc 2x a year.yes you can control temps with an air cooler, and get the same temps as a 3 fan radiator water cooler. I'll post the results without adding a watt limit in the mobo post screen.here is the parts i bought to air cool running the new cinabench 2024 for 30 mins i can get max performance on a defualt non OC not hitting above 99C on the P cores1. Noctua NH-D15 chromax.Black | Dual-Tower CPU Cooler | 140mm | Black2. Noctua NF-A15 HS-PWM chromax.Black.swap (this adds a 3rd fan for the air cooler you'll need it)3. FDXGYH 4 Pcs CPU Heatsink Fan Buckle PC Mainboard CPU Radiator Fan 12CM Wire Buckle Upper Hook Type Fixing Clip  (these buckles are compatible with noctus 140mm fans)4. Easycargo 40mm Heatsink Kit 40mmx40mmx20mm (this you place on the flat base of the noctua cooler will help dissipate heat)5. Easycargo 100pcs Heatsink Assortment Kit Small Cooler Aluminum Heat (these you throw on the back of your mobo on and around the mount brackets you'll me amazed how adding heat sinks on the back of the mobo will reduce temps)6. Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut (this is the best thermal grease cooler by 1-2c cooler than artic silver mx 6)7. Thermalright Intel 12th/13th Generation LGA1700 Anti-Bending Buckle ( a must add a little thermal grease on the cpu side flaps this buckle is 100% aluminum will al help dissipate heat.then i went to my mother board software options (mobo is an MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX) select ""CPU cooler tuning"" select ""tower air cooling"" which will limit the wattage draw to under 300w also note if you are not using a Water Cooling Reservoir  you should also use this option, water cooling a 14900k and OC really does require a reservoir, and a 4x 120 fan size radiator if you're simply using a pre-built 2x fan radiator its not enough to handle the 14900k and the CPU is known for drawing 370w plus!!so using air cooled i got a 2371 score with no watt limiter option an temps were 78-100c on the p cores, and with the 300 watt limit the score was  2328 with temps 70-99c never hit 100c case the limiter would kick in. (note this is from CPU testing that punishes the CPU realistically i don't see this CPU going over 88c even on the most demanding game in 3 years.i personally do not recommend OC this CPU its already been pushed to its limits by INTEL at best for another 100 watts when all you're getting is 3-4 more FPS and that's not worth it. and all these people bragging a 6.2-6.5ghz OC, there just flexing for clout, then they take the CPU back to default. i already have my P cores spiking to 6.002 at 288-300 watts, and under 99c temps; adding 0.198mhz will meaning nothing for apps and gaming.personal note the MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX Gaming Motherboard is absolutely amazing at squeezing out all the performance of the 14900k worth the $700 price never crashed during testing that 26 power phases is godly  compared to my last gen EVGA x299 dark had 12 phase...RIP EGA :(","Reviewed in the United States on 11 February 2024","Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i9-14900K New Gaming Desktop Processor 24 cores (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked","",""
"Tatiana Lopez","5","","This is something that a lot of people do not understand about processors. If you put too much voltage you are going to damage it. I want to delid it but I don't see the need and here is whyEven if I can get it 20 degrees cooler it will not matter It will still need 3.5 to 4.2 volts to stay stable at advertised speeds.I am running it @ 5.4 GHZ all P cores and this thing is unbelievably reliable . And maybe 10 seconds extra to render vs 5.7 to 6.0 GHZI get the point that ppl want to have the Bragging rights to say that it runs that fast but it will gwt damaged guaranteed 400 watts is a lot for that little unit. I think that 5.4 5.3 5.2 is more than enough specially when you have a total of 32 threads and gaming is practically single threaded . And most games are GPU bound. I only use it in the gaming department for Flight simulator and have not seen it above 68 degrees.I had a 4770 k and still running strong at 4.5 GHZ in a very small case.Intel is a beast and this I 9 is very good . Future proof for at least 5 years to come .Note. I have delided at least 20 cpus and the ones that got damaged were the ones that got a lot of voltage .

"Eric E.","5","","So I finally upgraded my home workstation, and went to this new i9-14900K. It is incredibly fast. I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.! Also, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly. Applications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build. The one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims. With this new cpu, I can only run 2 GPU's and they run at 8x, cause they share the 16x, and that does leave me 4 full pcie4.0 lanes for the system drive. It is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it. One thing EVERYBODY should be aware of, is these new intel chips have P cores and E cores. Something my old cpu did NOT have. E-cores can severely impact certain software performance. When I booted up the new machine and tried my Ableton DAW  for the first time, I was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost, and the software was literally almost unusable.! The E-cores were slowing the software down so bad, I could barely change settings in the preferences.! It was that bad. I had to install process lasso ( fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it ) and disable the use of E-cores for Ableton and then it worked very fast and is great.!","Reviewed in the United States on 19 March 2024","Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i9-14900K New Gaming Desktop Processor 24 cores (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked","",""

My station is primarily used as a work station though it scores well with PC Mark 10 and cinebench. 3D Mark declares the obvious that I need to upgrade my video card from several years ago.

"elviscera","3","","Once they came down in price, I did get a i9-14900K as an ""upgrade"" from a i9-13900KF to  i9-14900K .  It's OK but I can't rave over it.  It is more of an sideways change rather than an upgrade.The i9-14900K is fast but not more so that a i9-13900K.  For me, the Cinebench R23 scores are about the same for 13th versus 14th gen.  Though the i9-14900K appears to run DDR5 more stably and at higher frequencies than the i9-13900K.  Also, the i9-14900K is enabled for XTU AI enable tuning in XTU but it's not that helpful.  I even wonder if it is worth getting a K at all, these CPU's are plenty fast for gaming without overclocking.I did NOT notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures.  Maybe a slight improvement but I did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so I am doubtful that the running temps are better.  Also, I suggest that you NOT let these chips get anywhere near TjMax (100C).  I had one i9-13900KF literally fail due to allowing it to get to TjMax frequently when stress testing.  A second one became slightly flaky.I thought the built in ARC display support of the K version might be helpful since I intended to devote the graphics card to the gaming monitor and use the built-in ARC on a side display.  But as it turns out, it wasn't worth it for me.  If you are gaming with this level of processor, you really need a comparable graphics card but most of them will drive four displays.  IMO, you are better off getting a KF and spending the money so saved on better graphics card.The original asking price was insane, I bought it on a whim on a late night.  On the morning morning after, I had buyers remorse, tried to cancel but could not, so instead, I refused the package.  It took literally 6 months to get a refund.  That was rather irksome.","Reviewed in the United States on 5 April 2024","Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i9-14900K New Gaming Desktop Processor 24 cores (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked","",""

After switching back to auto clock, I still managed the same temps, but getting 5.1-5.2Ghz on Pcore and 4.3 on Ecore. If my case allowed 120mm fans, I would of most definitely installed 240mm AIO cooler. That for sure would of helped with the temps and get me higher benchmark numbers.When it came to rendering a 20 minute 4k video on sony Vegas Pro 18 (IGPU only), it took about 15 minutes to complete it vs my I9 9900k that would of taken over an hour to finish it (RTX 3060).

"Another Customer","5","","Sorta came from a 13900k but I gave that to a relative after their x299/i9-7940x system began to have issues. He bought a z790 board and was amazed how far ahead the 13900k is in comparison an overclocked Skylake-X processor. He fixed the issue with the x299 system, but he decided to stay with Raptor Lake. All of which is okay by me because that old 13900k had no overclocking headroom, and I could only undervolt it by 5mv before it became unstable. I was going to buy another 13900k or maybe the ks version, but I decided to wait for the 14900k.The 14900k I got on the other hand has some overclocking headroom. I already set all P-cores to 5.8GHz, while keeping the double-core Turbo Boost at 6.0GHz. I also set the cache to 5.2Ghz and it's completely stable. I was not able to raise the multiplier at all with my 13900k. Just happy my 14900k isn't a lottery loser.While the clock of both the 13900ks and 14900k are the same, the 13900ks has a cherry picked memory controller. If you're looking to do a ton of RAM overclocking then the 13900ks may be the way to go.... but that's not to say if you'd get a 14900k with a good memory controller. Both my 13900k and 14900k work with DDR5-7200 RAM with XMP set, and no adjustments to the memory controller voltages.If you're buying the 14900k off the get-go and building a new system around it, then I recommend pairing it with a motherboard that has the BIOS Flashback feature.","Reviewed in the United States on 22 October 2023","Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i9-14900K New Gaming Desktop Processor 24 cores (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked","",""

"Colby Pugh","4","","I built PC with the new Intel i9-14900k, and I must say, it's a beast of a processor. Coming from an i7-8700k, the performance boost is nothing short of incredible. Multitasking, gaming, and content creation have all seen a significant improvement. Multithreaded applications and gaming experiences run smoother.  It's a productivity powerhouse. The clock speeds are no slouch either, making it excellent for single-threaded tasks and gaming. The major downside of this CPU is the heat it generates. Even with a high-end cooling solution, it tends to run hot, and that's something you must take into consideration when setting up your cooling solution. Be ready for this CPU to draw a significant amount of power at full load. It can put quite a load on your power supply and might necessitate an upgrade if you're not already prepared. The Intel i9-14900k is an incredible processor, and the upgrade from an i7-8700k is substantial. Its exceptional performance in various tasks justifies its price tag. If you're willing to address these challenges, you'll be rewarded with a fantastic computing experience.","Reviewed in the United States on 20 October 2023","Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i9-14900K New Gaming Desktop Processor 24 cores (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked","",""

"Average Customer","5","","How many of you just need a fast processor for standard home/office work? Buy this and call it a day.If you need something to handle Microsoft Office, any browser (your internet connection matters more), and basic applications, the 12100 is all you need. Loading time is very good. You really don't need amazing graphics to perform any of these tasks. I'm using integrated video and it suits me just fine. My other computer uses the APU on an AMD 5600G and I've never had issues. I paired this CPU with a barebones Gigabyte motherboard (cheapest I could find) and 8GB of DDR4 memory and it rivals my AMD setup for plain tasks.Don't feel like you need an i5, i7, or even the i3 12400 if you just need an everyday computer for watching videos, doing online banking, or crunching out work material (unless you are editing heavy media). This i3-12100 is the equivalent of a quad core processor from years back. If you are working on virtual machines, doing strong programming, have a million windows open, need to use Adobe Creative Suite to quickly produce and export content, then you may want to consider moving up to a stronger processor. Even so, this one is still pretty good - it will just take longer to complete some things.I'm overall very happy with this processor and I think most households who have similar requirements will be satisfied. The 12400 did get to $160 at some point so that could be something to look at to future proof a machine since it has six cores (not that I need them right now).","Reviewed in the United States on 19 May 2022","Intel Core I3 (12Th Gen) I3-12100 Quad-Core (4 Core) 3.30 Ghz Processor - Retail Pack LGA 1700","",""

"swmagicien","4","","I have this installed into an Asrock motherboard. It works great. I was a little misinformed about the built in graphics and thought when I bought it was I was getting Iris Xe, but it's something called UHD. The product description clearly says UHD, so my bad really. Most of the other Intel 12th gen chips with graphics processing have Iris Xe which has many more graphics processing units. For sure the UHD is fine for many things including streaming video. Not sure about 3D gaming, though. Had I know it was UHD and not Iris, I might have saved $30 or so and bought the version without the graphics. On the other hand, I liked the idea of onboard graphics as a backup or alternative. In either case, this i3 runs like a champ compared to the quad core phenom ii based system it's replacing.I'm not sure it's relevant here but I think I should mention that my Asrock board can't make use of the on board UHD graphics when you set BIOS to legacy mode. You need to use the UEFI mode in order to use the on board graphics. Not sure if that's typical of other boards or board brands. With my Asrock board, you need a discrete graphics card to use the legacy bios mode to boot from an old non-UEFI installation of windows. If that doesn't make sense to you, don't worry about it.","Reviewed in the United States on 29 September 2023","Intel Core I3 (12Th Gen) I3-12100 Quad-Core (4 Core) 3.30 Ghz Processor - Retail Pack LGA 1700","",""

The integrated graphics aren't amazing but they get the job done and have allowed me to run light games like Roblox and Civ VI while I save for a graphics card. The stock cooler is not amazing at cooling but the i3 12100 doesn't take much power so while any new cooler would probably be an improvement, this one has been doing just fine.

"Amazon User","5","","I didnt expect much from an i3, but once again I was blinded by the label. This product holds the price to performance of a console KILLER. It's single core power is up there with the ryzen 7000 series processors, supporting ddr5 ram at only 90 dollars WITH the cooler. Assuming your average cooler is about 10 dollars, you really can't go wrong with an 84 dollar cpu capable of 500+ fps on minecraft, 300+ fps on valorant, etc.I will say though, a quad core cpu in 2023 is a bit questionable, since you'll have extra issues streaming and recording games. The cache is also pretty low for this cpu, but you really can't hate too much on a 90 dollar cpu at this magnitude of performance.Overall solid cpu, more than I need for games and editing.

"Franck de BZH","5","","This 12th generation of Intel processors is decidedly excellent! For 20 years, I had only bought AMD, but when reading many tests that had highlighted the qualities of the 12100F, I therefore decided to take the plunge.At the start, I wanted a processor that is both powerful enough in the games, and which does not heat (and therefore that does not consume).Already because it was intended to be placed in an HTPC, having in essence a somewhat complicated airflow, and then because I wanted to optimize the performance/energy ratio. I think it's mission accomplished.Reading movies, or while listening to music, the Intel processor and the graphics card (GTX 1660 Ti) do not each exceed 35 ¬∞ C, and climb respectively at 47 ¬∞ C and 62 ¬∞ C during the game sessions.I specifies that the 12100F is cooled by a low profile nightua NHL-12S fan, supported by an Arctic P12 fan, and is fixed in the socket by an adjustment frame, supposed to avoid deformations of the processor surface, of thermalright brand. In the end of power, this processor can be associated with any graphics card without limiting the potential of the latter, except perhaps those above the very powerful AMD RX 6900 XT and RTX 3080 Ti.On the other hand, the Intel will fish a little without being ridiculous.Know that it has as much responding as a high -end of 4 years ago. To summarize, with regard to the price, the 12100F is the best for a computer intended for versatile use andeconomic.","Reviewed in France on 6 October 2022","Intel Core i3 12100F 12th Gen Generation Desktop PC Processor 4 CPU with 12MB Cache and up to 4.30 GHz Clock Speed LGA 1700 Socket","",""

I have had the ryzen since launch.I was expecting similar performance maybe slightly better. However, this i5-13400f not only performs better than my old ryzen. It also does it at much cooler temps then the ryzen put out. My ryzen idled at 35c and got up to around 79c on heavy load. The i5 idles at 22c and has only gotten as high as 55c max under heavy land. That's 13 degrees cooler than the ryzen at idle and 24 degrees cooler under load.With that said that's a huge improvement over my old ryzen. Which I shouldn't be surprised that ryzen is a few generations old now. But damn. Definitely worth grabbing one.My old ryzen would get bogged down if I created a video game asset in blender around if I went too crazy. So far the i5 hasn't been bothered by anything I do in blender.

As I said, I bought it for the video edition, I haveStatus doing a test with the integrated graph, (I have not yet placed the dedicated one). I have taken a pleasant surprise, because with this configuration without integrated graphics, I have created a 15 -minute video, without tracing or anything, (it was a test), The raw video, after 3 or 4 minutes, video finished when with my old I7 it took half an hour to 45 minutes, I am talking about a 1920x1080 resolution.I mean, you can with it.Maybe it also has something to do with the editing program that is not of the pointers that everyone names, but that is fantastic and does the same.I have been using the Magix Edition program, if my old PC could, this one owed much more, as it has been, since the program itself does not require so many resources. It is very happy.I have it with the dissipator that everyone hates, (the one of origin) that comes next to the processor.

So far it's been real good to her.The only odd note about this processor and it's IGPU counterpart is, this one have more cache.  While the IGPU version have less cache.  Try to weigh in your options when looking at this over the other.  I picked this due to a tiny drop in price with the added extra cache.  But, it wouldn't be great for my itx rebuild I did later on.

"Marv","5","Bought this processor and a cheap MATX motherboard so I could run MicroSquish Windoze 11","So I was stuck on Windows 10 with my LGA 1151 core i7-6700.  This processor at an affordable price more than doubled, maybe tripled my cpu performance while still accepting my older DDR4 3200 ram and m.2 storage.  Also allows me to update my machine to Windows 11 as a 13th gen cpu.  I considered running 8th gen chip in my older mother board by flashing the bios with a coffee lake chip support, but rather than deal with all the isolation on the cpu pins and bios frustration, i opted to spend 60 bucks for a new MATX board and this cpu.  The only complaint I have is the cpu box was clearly opened and I am left wondering if this was dropped into someone else's board at some point and returned.  I don't like that when the product is being advertised as new.  The seller was Amazon LLC too so I am not sure what is going on with that.  I have half a mind to return it for a replacement but alas it is installed and seems to be running fine so I really don't want to pack it up and ship it back.  My chip runs pretty cool with the stock fan, 3d mark cpu stress tests never took it above 71C but that fan sure kicked in when the cpu was running at 100% utilization.  At idle on my computer the chip purrs along at 30-35C with the fan running somewhere around 40%.  All in all a good purchase to get my machine ready for Win 11.  Will work for a budget gaming build but expect to pay a little more for a good GPU.","Reviewed in the United States on 18 November 2023","Intel Core i3-13100 Desktop Processor 4 cores (4 P-cores + 0 E-cores) 12MB Cache up to 4.5 GHz","",""

After taking the fan off and powering it separately it spun up to 3000RPM. I noticed that the wires were pinched along the heatsink because the housing was screwed down too tight. It happens.

"Garrett","5","Great for gaming, don't listen to the everyone saying it's not enough.","A lot of people will say that i3s are not enough in 2024 and can't run anything. Couldn't be further from the truth. This cpu is good enough more than 90-95% of people. If you know this cpu isn't powerful enough for your work, then you are in that 5%.For gaming and for basic office/school work, this cpu is unmatched when it comes to price vs performance. The cooler it comes with had an interesting mounting mechanism but it keeps my CPU nice and cool. I've been playing Hogwart's Legacy and Baldur's Gate 3 at 1080p on ultra settings with my Arc A580.Also I managed to snag this at $95 brand new, so basically I was forced to buy it at that point or facepalm myself.","Reviewed in the United States on 1 June 2024","Intel Core i3-14100F Desktop Processor 4 cores (4 P-cores + 0 E-cores) up to 4.7 GHz","",""

"Hau Le","5","Thanks Amazon for fast shipping","Upgrading from i5 6600. My new i3 is so cute im going to nickname it AWESOME! The cooler is very elegant. I hope it works! Thanks! Amazon for fast shipping arriving a day early and packaged nice!I was really excited about the cooler but the mounting mechanism is aweful. It dont clip dont nice now matter how hard i tried. Theres always one last clip just loose. I can reach on the backside and pop it off easily with my finger. I can understand people on a budget and needs to rely on this cooler and intel provides, Thanks! but i switched over to a cheap waterblock and i felt way more at ease.Intel skimped on the thermal paste. upon first installation i tried a game and it throttled my cpu with turbo boost on. I took the cooler off to try another cooler and looked at the paste it barely cover the cpu.I added more paste on top of intel paste and got a 15c drop and no more throttle. If you dont have better cooling solution i advise you get more thermal paste for sure.I test CPU on game COD MW3 before with intel 6600 i get 35-50fps with a lot of micro stutter.now with new intel i3 its getting 80-120fps smooth. and the fps counter saying its only using about 10-15 % cpu activity! im very happy.
